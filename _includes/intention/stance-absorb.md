#### Stance Intention: Absorb Hits
**Stance**: 0 AP

When you declare this intention, you forgo any attempt at defense and instead focus on taking the hits as they come. While in this stance, the result of your Defensive Roll is halved, but you do not lose any AP when hit by an attack. When you receive a Critical, you still lose AP as per the Critical's level.
