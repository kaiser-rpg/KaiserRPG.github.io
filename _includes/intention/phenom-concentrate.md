#### Phenom Intention: Concentrate on Manifesting

When you declare this intention, you must also declare a phenom. You then focus on manifesting that phenom. Next round when you take the Manifest Phenom Intention, you gain a +1 bonus to Manifest Potential the first time you try to manifest the chosen phenom that round. If you take this intention for three rounds in a row, you gain a +2 bonus. Five rounds will grant you a +3 bonus. Ten rounds will grant +4 bonus. If you do not use the phenom, the bonus is lost.
