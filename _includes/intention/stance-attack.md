#### Stance Intention: Total Attack {#total-attack}
**Stance**: 0 AP

When you declare this intention, you enter a state of pure offense. While in this stance, you gain a +3 to your Offensive Roll taken as part of the Attack Action and you do not lose any AP when hit by an attack. In return, your Defensive Rolls are zero. When you receive a Critical, you still lose AP as per the Critical's level.

If you have Damage Resistance, while in this stance you lose your Absorption.

This stance cannot be combined with Absorb Hits or Total Defense stances.
