#### Phenom Intention: Manifest Phenom

When you declare this intention, you can manifest one or more phenom this round. In order to manifest a chosen phenom, you make a Difficulty Check using your Phenom Potential with the proper action. Then compare the final roll to the phenoms degrees. You manifest the highest degree that you have mastered and your roll matches or beats.

If you wish to manifest more than one phenom in a round, you can chose to hold back some of your natural Potential, effectively splitting it between phenom. You must use at least one point for each phenom you manifest.

{% include example.html content="For example, Sarah wishes to manifest two Immolation phenoms this round with her Phenom Potential of 5. She choses to split her potential to manifest one Immolation with 2 and a the other with 3 Phenom Potential. Since she has a +2 to her Potential Roll to manifest Immolation (due to permanent PP spending), the final number added to the roll is 4 and 5." %}
