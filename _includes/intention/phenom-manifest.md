#### Phenom Intention: Manifest Phenom

When you declare this intention, you can manifest one or more phenom this round. In order to manifest a phenom, you make a special Skill Check using your Manifest Potential with the proper action. Using your Final Skill Roll, determine the highest Degree of Difficulty it beats and that you have mastered. The phenom then manifests at that Degree of Difficulty.

You can manifest more than one phenom this round. But doing so causes you to split your Manifest Potential. You can divide your Final Manifest Potential Value between multiple phenom, but you must give each Skill Check at least 1 point. This division must be declared before making your roll. Once you have used all your Manifest Potential, you cannot manifest any more phenom this round.

{% include example.html content="Sarah has a Final Manifest Potential Value of 5. So in a single round she could manifest one phenom with a +5 to the Skill Check. Or, she could manifest three phenom, two of them with a +2 and the last one with a +1." %}
