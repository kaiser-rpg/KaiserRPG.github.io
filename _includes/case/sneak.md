### Sneak Attack

Sneak attack occurs when you attempt to make an Offensive Roll against an opponent who is unaware of your presence, position, or means of attack. There are a few different use cases of sneak attack outlined below. It is left up to Game Master to ultimately decide if an attack is hidden or not.

If you wish to perform a sneak attack without giving away your position, your Offensive Skill cannot be above your Stealth Skill. Some powers will give away your position, no matter how stealthy you are.

#### Opponent is unaware
If an opponent is unaware of any danger and you are hidden from them, then you gain the <span class="label label-default">Surprise</span> state over zer and ze apply the <span class="label label-default">Totally Blind</span> state to their Defensive Roll. If an opponent is targeted by or sees one of your attacks, ze will no longer be <span class="label label-default">Surprised</span> when it becomes zir turn until the End Phase. If the opponent does not take the [Alert to Danger Stance](rule_combat_action_point.html##alert-to-danger) next round, then they can be Surprised again if they did not spot you.

{% example.html content="Klaus is hiding up in a tree from a pair of guards playing poker below. The guards are not alert to danger since they are distracted by their game. Klaus fires two arrows at the first guard, he has two Attack Action each round. Both arrow attacks are made with the Surprise State and Totally Blind Situation. The first guard falls unconscious from the wounds and the second one takes the Alert to Danger Stance on his turn." %}

#### Opponent is alert
If an opponent is alert to danger, but does not know where it will come from or what form it will take, ze apply the <span class="label label-default">Totally Blind</span> state. The opponent must be aware of your presence or have taken the [Alert to Danger Stance](rule_combat_action_point.html##alert-to-danger) to be considered for this use case.

{% example.html content="Klaus is hidden from a guard how is on patrol around a warehouse. The guard is being careful and alert to danger. Klaus throws a poisoned dart at the guard to try to knock him out. The guard applies the Totally Blind Situation to defend himself but he is not surprised. If Klaus does it properly, he will also apply the From Behind Situation." %}

#### Opponent is aware
If an opponent is aware of your general position, but cannot see what you are doing and does not know what form an attack will take, ze apply the <span class="label label-default">Partially Blind</span> state. This use case does not require the [Alert to Danger Stance](rule_combat_action_point.html##alert-to-danger).

{% example.html content="Klaus is hidden from a guard behind a large crate within the shadows of a warehouse. The guard knows that someone is over there but cannot see his opponent's movements nor does he know how his opponent will attack. Klaus, using the shadows to stay hidden, throws a knife at the guard. The guard applies the Partially Blind Situation to defend himself." %}

#### Opponent can see you
If an opponent is aware of your exact position and has some means to understand how you will act, ze do not apply any of the Blind states nor do you gain the <span class="label label-default">Surprise</span> state over them.
