### Attack an Opening
**Reaction**: 1 AP

You can take this reaction when an opponent gives you an opening you can perform the _Attack Action_ against the opponent. The attack must be made with a hand-to-hand weapon and cannot be used to perform a maneuver. If an opponent has the Surprise State over you, you are unable to attack them. 

If the opponent is disengaging from hand-to-hand combat, you can perform this action. You have the Flanked State over the target. The targets remaining Movement Distance is reduced by the Final Damage. This does not allow you to hit a creature as it moves past; you must have been in hand-to-hand combat with them previously. To hit a creature moving past you, you have to _Prepared an Offensive Roll_.

If the opponent is performing a ranged attack against a creature that is not you and is not Shooting Defensively, you can perform this action. The target makes their complete Offensive Roll before you can attack their opening.
