#### Trap: Full Attack
**Attack**: 0 AP

When you take this maneuver, you release your trapped opponent at just the right time so that you do not suffer the [@state Partially Restrained @] state caused by your tap but they still apply their [@state Restrained @] state. Once the Opposed Skill Check is complete, your opponent is no longer [@state Restrained @] by you.
