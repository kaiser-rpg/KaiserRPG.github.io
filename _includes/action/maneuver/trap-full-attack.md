#### Trap: Full Attack
**Attack**: 0 AP

When you take this maneuver, you release your trapped opponent at just the right time so that you do not suffer the Partially Restrained state caused by trapping but your opponent still applies their Restrained state. Once the Opposed Skill Check is complete, your opponent is no longer Restrained by you.
