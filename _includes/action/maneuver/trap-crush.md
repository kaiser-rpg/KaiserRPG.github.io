#### Trap: Crush
**Intention**: Complete AP

The _Crush_ intention allows you use your physical might to crush your opponent. In order to take this intention, you must have Mostly or Fully Restrained your opponent. You do not need to take the _Maintain Trap_ action this round to prevent the free escape attempt. The opponent feels you starting to squeeze them.

On the End Phase, you and your opponent make an Opposed Strength Check. The opponent can add their Impact AV to the check. The opponent takes 5 damage for each Degree of Success you gain. If the DoS is greater than 5, the damage increases to 10 per point.

If you used this intention on your opponent in the previous round and gained 5 or more DoS, then the damage this round will start at 10 per point. If you gain 5 DoS again, the opponent takes 20 per point. Additional DoS do not further increase the damage.
