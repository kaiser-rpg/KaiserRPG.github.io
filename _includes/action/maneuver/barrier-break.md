### Barrier Break
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you try to destroy the supernatural barrier protecting your opponent. The [@action Barrier Break @] maneuver does not cause the defender to take any damage. If your target uses the [@action Defend with a Supernatural Barrier @] or ze is protected by a similar power, your attack is directed to the barrier. Whether the barrier manages to block the attack or not, it takes damage as normal. If you successfully hit, then you deal additional damage equal to the Base Damage times your Degree of Success on the Offensive Roll. Then if your weapon has a positive Breakage value, you can add your Breakage twice.

This maneuver can be performed with any kind of single target and non-area attack power. If the Game Master permits, you can declare that you will use this maneuver after making your Offensive Roll but before the Defensive Roll's results are announced.
