### Trap
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to pin your opponent. You make an Offensive Roll with a -4 penalty. The _Trap_ maneuver does not cause the defender to take any damage.

If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success on the Opposed Skill Check, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained less than 10 DoS on the Opposed Skill Check, you suffer a `-3` penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained 20 or more DoS, you gain a `+3` to the Opposed Characteristic Check. 

You can choose either Strength or Dexterity, while the defender choses between Strength, Dexterity, or Agility. Compare the Degrees of Success to the table below for the result of the _Trap_.

If your opponent is successful on the Opposed Characteristic Check, ze may instead trap you. Their Degrees of Success are reduced by 10 and then compared to the Trap Result Table. This does not cost your opponent any Action Points.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks and requires a free hand or powers that list this maneuver. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.

While trapping your opponent, you are unable to move freely, applying the <span class="label label-default">Partially Restrained</span> state to all your actions. Every Offensive or Defensive Roll you perform allows your opponent a free Opposed Characteristic Check, even if ze are <span class="label label-default">Fully Restrained</span>.

In order to free zirself, a <span class="label label-default">Partially Restrained</span> or <span class="label label-default">Mostly Restrained</span> opponent, as an Active Action costing 2 AP, can attempt a new Opposed Characteristic Check with a `-3` penalty. Ze can only take that action once per round. If ze do not take the action to free zirself, ze get a free Opposed Characteristic Check, still with the `-3` penalty, during the End Phase. A <span class="label label-default">Fully Restrained</span> opponent is unable to attempt to free themselves, unless you perform Attack Actions or do not take the action to maintain the trap.

Once you have an opponent trapped, you gain additional actions you can perform.
