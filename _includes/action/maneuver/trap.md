### Trap
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to pin your opponent. You make an Offensive Roll with a `-4` deed penalty. The [@action Trap @] maneuver does not cause the defender to take any damage.

If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success on the Opposed Skill Check, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained less than 10 DoS on the Opposed Skill Check, you suffer a `-3` deed penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained 20 or more DoS, you gain a `+3` deed bonus to the Opposed Characteristic Check. 

You can choose either [@stat Strength @] or [@stat Dexterity @], while the defender choses between [@stat Strength @], [@stat Dexterity @], or [@stat Agility @]. Compare your Degrees of Success to the table below for the result of the [@action Trap @].

If your opponent is successful on the Opposed Characteristic Check, ze may instead trap you. Their Degrees of Success are reduced by 10 and then compared to the Trap Result Table. This does not cost your opponent any AP.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks and requires a free hand or powers that list this maneuver. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.

While trapping your opponent, you are unable to move freely, applying the [@state Partially Restrained @] state to all your actions. Every Offensive or Defensive Roll you perform allows your opponent a free Opposed Characteristic Check, even if ze are [@state Fully Restrained @].

In order to free zirself, a [@state Partially Restrained @] or [@state Mostly Restrained @] opponent, as an Active Action costing 2 AP, can attempt a new Opposed Characteristic Check with a `-3` deed penalty. Ze can only take that action once per round. If ze do not take the action to free zirself, ze get a free Opposed Characteristic Check, still with the `-3` deed penalty, during the End Phase. A [@state Fully Restrained @] opponent is unable to attempt to free themselves, unless you perform Offensive or Defensive Rolls or do not take the action to maintain the trap.

Once you have an opponent trapped, you gain additional actions you can perform.
