### Sunder
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you strike at your opponent's weapon or armor with the intent of breaking it. You make an Offensive Roll, using the [@action Directed Attack @] penalties, against your opponent's hand or torso. The Final Damage of the attack is reduced by half. Then, if you gained at least five Degrees of Success, you can perform a Breakage Check against the target's weapon or armor.

This maneuver can be performed with any kind of single target and non-area attack power as long as it has a Breakage value. If the Game Master permits, you can declare that you will use this maneuver after making your Offensive Roll but before the Defensive Roll's results are announced.
