### Knock Out
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you strike your opponent with non-lethal force with the intent of knocking them out. You make an Offensive Roll, using the [@action Directed Attack @] penalties, against your opponent's head. The Final Damage of the attack is reduced by half. However, the Game Master should consider the full Final Damage to determine if a Critical occurs. If the Critical level is higher than 5, the target is automatically knocked out. When you use this maneuver, a Critical cannot cause negative effects beyond those of being knocked out, losing AP, or inflicting the [@state Pain @] state. It can never cause automatic death. 

If you attempt to [@action Knock Out @] an opponent using something other than an Impact weapon, you suffer an additional penalty of `-4` to your Offensive Roll. 

This maneuver can be performed with any kind of single target and non-area attack power. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll. [@state Knock Out @] does not work against creatures with the Rex Damage Role.
