### Knock Out
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you strike your opponent with non-lethal force with the intent of knocking them out. You make an Offensive Roll, using the _Directed Attack_ penalties, against your opponent's head. The Final Damage of the attack is reduced by half. However, the Game Master should consider the full Final Damage to determine if a Critical occurs. If the Critical level is higher than 5, the wounded combatant is automatically Knocked Out. When you use this maneuver, a Critical cannot cause negative effects beyond those of being knocked out, losing AP, or inflicting the Pain State. It can never cause automatic death. 

If you attempt to _Knock Out_ an opponent using something other than an Impact weapon, you suffer an additional penalty of -4 to your Offensive Roll. 

This maneuver can be performed with any kind of single target and non-area attack power. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll. Disable does not work against creatures with Damage Resistance.
