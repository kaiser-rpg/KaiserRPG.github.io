### Gain the Upper Hand
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you use your acrobatics to position yourself on your opponent's flank before attacking them with a hand-to-hand weapon. Before making the Offensive Roll, make an Opposed Skill Check with your [@skill Acrobatics @] against the [@skill Strike @] or [@skill Acrobatics @] of your opponent. 

With less than 10 Degrees of Success, you are unable to maneuver into position but you do not leave yourself open. If you gain 10 DoS, you have positioned yourself on your opponent's flank. If you gain 15 or more DoS, you have maneuvered yourself behind your opponent. You can then make your Offensive Roll with a hand-to-hand weapon.

If you fail the Opposed Skill Check, your opponent has prevented your repositioning and you lose the ability to make your Offensive Roll. The opponent can then perform a [@action Counter @], gaining their full Degrees of Success for the Counter bonus.

Each time you use this maneuver against an opponent, ze gains a `+1` deed bonus to defend against it until two weeks have passed since you last used the maneuver against zir.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.
