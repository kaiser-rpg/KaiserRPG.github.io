### Secondary Damage Type
**Attack**: 0 AP

When you use this maneuver, you use your weapon to deal a different type of damage than it was designed. You make an Offensive Roll with a `-1` penalty but the damage produced by the attack becomes one of the Secondary Damage Types the weapon is capable of.

This maneuver can only be performed with weapons or powers with a secondary Damage Type. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.
