### Secondary Damage Type
**Attack**: 0 AP

When you use this maneuver, you use your weapon to deal a different type of damage than it was designed. You make an Offensive Roll with a -1 penalty but the damage produced by the attack becomes one of the secondary damage types the weapon is capable of.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand weapons with the secondary damage trait. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.
