### Feint
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you use your sleight of hand to momentarily fool your opponent before attacking them with a hand-to-hand weapon. Before making the Offensive Roll, make an Opposed Skill Check with your Sleight of Hand against the Notice of your opponent.

For every 2 Degrees of Success you gain, you impose a -1 penalty to your opponent's Defensive Roll, to a maximum of -10. If the opponent reduces the penalty from the Blind Side State or Flank State, they also reduce the penalty from the Feint maneuver. You can then make your Offensive Roll with a hand-to-hand weapon.

If you fail the Opposed Skill Check, your opponent saw through your feint and you lose the ability to make your Offensive Roll. The opponent can then Counter, gaining their DoS for the counter bonus.

Each time you use this maneuver against an opponent, they gain a +1 to defend against it until two weeks have passed since you last used the maneuver against them.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks or powers that list this maneuver. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.
