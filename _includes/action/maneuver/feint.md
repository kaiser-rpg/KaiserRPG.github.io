### Feint
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you use your sleight of hand to momentarily fool your opponent before attacking them with a hand-to-hand weapon. Before making the Offensive Roll, make an Opposed Skill Check with your [@skill Sleight of Hand @] against the [@skill Notice @] of your opponent.

For every 2 Degrees of Success you gain, you impose a `-1` penalty to your opponent's Defensive Roll, to a maximum of `-10`. If the opponent reduces the penalty from the [@state Blind Side @] or [@state Flank @] state, ze also reduce the penalty from the [@action Feint @] maneuver. You can then make your Offensive Roll with a hand-to-hand weapon.

If you fail the Opposed Skill Check, your opponent saw through your feint and you lose the ability to make your Offensive Roll. The opponent can then [@action Counter @], gaining their full DoS for the counter bonus.

Each time you use this maneuver against an opponent, ze gain a `+1` to defend against it until two weeks have passed since you last used the maneuver against them.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks or powers that list this maneuver. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.
