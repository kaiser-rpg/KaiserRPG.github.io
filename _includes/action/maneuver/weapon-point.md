### Put at Weapon's Point
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to get the drop on your opponent by putting your weapon in a position where it could easily kill them -- for instance, a knife at their throat -- but without causing them damage. You make an Offensive Roll with a `-10` penalty. If you obtain at least 1 Degree of Success, you gain the [@state At Weapon's Point @] state over your opponent, but you deal no damage.

With the [@state At Weapon's Point @] state over your opponent, at any point later you can perform the [@action Attack Action @] as a Swift Action. Once used to attack, the opponent loses the [@state At Weapon's Point @] state. If an opponent has the [@state Surprise @] state over you, ze can perform zir actions before you can take the Swift Action to attack. This can allow the opponent [@state At Weapon's Point @] to escape if ze chooses.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand weapons. If the Game Master permits, you can declare that you will use this maneuver after making your Offensive Roll but before the Defensive Roll's results are announced.
