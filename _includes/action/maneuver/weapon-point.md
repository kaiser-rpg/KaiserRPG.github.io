### Put at Weapon's Point
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to "get the drop" on your opponent by putting your weapon in a position where it could easily kill them (for instance, a knife at their throat) but without causing them damage. You make an Offensive Roll with a `-10` penalty. If you obtain at least 1 Degree of Success, you gain the <span class="label label-default">At Weapon's Point</span> state over your opponent, but you deal no damage.

With the <span class="label label-default">At Weapon's Point</span> state over your opponent, at any point later you can perform the _Attack Action_ as a Swift Action. Once used to attack, the opponent loses the <span class="label label-default">At Weapon's Point</span> state. If an opponent has the <span class="label label-default">Surprise</span> state over you, ze can perform zirs actions before you can take the Swift Action to attack. This can allow the opponent <span class="label label-default">At Weapon's Point</span> to escape if ze chooses.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand weapons. If the Game Master permits, you can declare that you will use this maneuver after making your Offensive Roll but before the Defensive Roll's results are announced.
