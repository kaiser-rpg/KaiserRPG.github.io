### Disarm
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to knock your opponent's weapon out of their hand. You make an Offensive Roll with a `-4` penalty. The _Disarm_ maneuver does not cause the defender to take any damage.

If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success on the Opposed Skill Check, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained less than 10 DoS on the Opposed Skill Check, you suffer a `-3` penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained 20 or more DoS, you gain a `+3` to the Opposed Characteristic Check. 

You and the defender can choose either [@stat Strength @] or [@stat Dexterity @]. If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success in the Opposed Characteristic Check, your opponent drops the targeted item.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks or powers that list this maneuver. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.
