### Impact
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to use your strength to push your opponent a distance. You must use a weapon that deals Impact Damage or an object with the Impact trait. You make an Offensive Roll with no penalty. The _Impact_ maneuver does not directly cause the defender to take any damage.

If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success on the Opposed Skill Check, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained less than 10 DoS on the Opposed Skill Check, you suffer a `-6` penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check as your impact just glances them. If you gained 10 or more DoS, you suffer a `-3` penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check as you hit them squarely. With 20 or more DoS, you gain a `+0` bonus to the Opposed Characteristic Check, as you score a direct hit on them.

You must use Strength, while the defender chooses between Strength, Constitution, or Agility. If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success in the Opposed Characteristic Check, your opponent is pushed some distance. 

For each Degree of Success, you gain on the Opposed Characteristic Check, the target is pushed up to a Base Distance based on the Strength of the Impact, found in the Impact Base Distance table. Usually this will be equal to your Strength Characteristic. Then, compare the distance ze would have traveled -- if ze collides with something, ze may stop or bounce off -- and what ze collides with to the Severity table. Take the Severity level in between the distance and collision to determine Final Damage; the Game Master can choose a value in the listed range. The Final Damage can be halved, round down, if the target makes an Athletics or Acrobatics Check with a Very Difficult (20) Degree of Difficulty; the target can add their Impact AV to this check. For every 4 Degrees of Success, the damage is halved again.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks or powers that list this maneuver. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.

This maneuver assumes you and the target are both of Medium Size. Naturally, the results will be different when a human makes an _Impact_ on a dragon. The Game Master can apply between a `+1` and `+10` to the Opposed Characteristic Check of the defender if the sizes are vastly different.
