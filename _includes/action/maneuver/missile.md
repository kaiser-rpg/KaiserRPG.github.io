### Multiple Missiles
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you launch several projectiles simultaneously to increase the destructive power of your attacks. You can prepare to launch up to three extra projectiles in a single attack. Each additional projectile increases the Base Damage by `+1` but causes a `-1` deed penalty to the Offensive Roll.

This being a single attack, this maneuver does not increase the Rate of Tire or Reload properties of the weapon. Some ranged weapons cannot be used in this way due to their design, such as a crossbow or pistol.

This maneuver can only be performed with ranged weapons or weapons with the [@trait Throwable @] trait. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.
