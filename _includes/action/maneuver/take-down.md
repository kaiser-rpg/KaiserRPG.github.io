### Take Down
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to tackle your opponent to bring them to the ground. You make an Offensive Roll with a -3 penalty, the penalty increases to -6 if you are wielding a two-handed weapon without the Take Down trait. The _Take Down_ maneuver does not cause the defender to take any damage.

If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success on the Opposed Skill Check, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained less than 10 DoS on the Opposed Skill Check, you suffer a -3 penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained 20 or more DoS, you gain a +3 to the Opposed Characteristic Check. 

You can choose either Strength or Dexterity, while the defender choses between Strength or Agility. If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success in the Opposed Characteristic Check, your opponent falls to the ground. If you gain 5 or more DoS, you do not fall to the ground with your opponent (unless you used a power to perform this maneuver).

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks or powers that list this maneuver. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.
