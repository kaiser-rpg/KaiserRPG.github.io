#### Spirit Intention: Fill Chakra

When you declare this intention, you can fill your Red, Green, and or Blue chakras with ki, from your Ki Reserve, equal to the that chakras value. If you are unable to perform somatic or verbal components, the amount you fill is halved, or quartered if you cannot perform either component. You can also chose to fill none of your chakras. If you take no other Intention or Action this round, you can gain the benefit of your chakra again at the end of the round, all modifiers apply. You are unable to accumulate more than five times your presence in each chakra.

With ki in your chakras, you can use them to activate any number of talents or techniques as long as you have the ki to spend. If the talent does not state what chakra to use, you can spend ki from any chakra.

If you have ki in your chakra from the previous round and do not take the Fill Chakra Intention again, all your ki returns to your Ki Reserve before rolling Initiative.

Once the sum of your accumulated ki is 20 or more, then your aura starts to become visible on the material plane. 

To use this Intention, you must first have mastered the Use of Ki Talent.
