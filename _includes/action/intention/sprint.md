### Sprint
**Intention**: Complete AP

The [@action Sprint @] intention allows you to gain a Movement Distance equal to your Sprint Distance. This movement is can be used by taking the [@action Move @] or [@action Step @] actions. You can only take this intention once per round and only if you have not taken the [@action Run @] intention. If you become effected by a power that increases or decreases your Movement Value, it can increase or decrease your remaining Distance.

Additionally, you gain a `+2` to your Initiative Roll.
