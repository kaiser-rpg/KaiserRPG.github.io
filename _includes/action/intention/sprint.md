### Sprint
**Intention**: Complete AP

The _Sprint_ intention allows you to gain a Movement Distance equal to your Sprint Distance. This movement is can be used by taking the _Move_ or _Step_ actions. You can only take this intention once per round and only if you have not taken the _Run_ intention. If you become effected by a power that increases or decreases your Movement Value, it can increase or decrease your remaining Distance.
