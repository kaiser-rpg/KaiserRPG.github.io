### Sprint
**Intention**: Complete AP

The Sprint intention allows you to gain a Movement Distance equal to your Sprint Distance. This movement is can be used by taking the Move or Step actions. You can only take this intention once per round and only if you have not taken the Run intention. If you become effected by a power that increases or decreases your Movement Value, it can increase or decrease your remaining Distance.
