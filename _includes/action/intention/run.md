### Run
**Intention**: 3 AP

The [@action Run @] intention allows you to gain a Movement Distance equal to your Run Distance. This movement is can be used by taking the [@action Move @] or [@action Step @] actions. You can only take this intention once per round and only if you have not taken the [@action Sprint @] intention. If you become effected by a power that increases or decreases your Movement Value, it can increase or decrease your remaining Distance.
