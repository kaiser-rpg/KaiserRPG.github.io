### Run
**Intention**: 3 AP

The _Run_ intention allows you to gain a Movement Distance equal to your Run Distance. This movement is can be used by taking the _Move_ or _Step_ actions. You can only take this intention once per round and only if you have not taken the _Sprint_ intention. If you become effected by a power that increases or decreases your Movement Value, it can increase or decrease your remaining Movement Distance.
