#### Magic Intention: Transfer Mana

When you declare this intention, as a Swift Action you can push an amount of mana up to your Mana Accumulation from your Pool to that of another. This transference requires you to be in direct contact with the creature or object with a Mana Pool. You can transfer mana to several different targets as long as the total mana transferred out of your Pool in a round is less than or equal to your MA.

If you are in contact with a Mana Battery, you can instead pull mana from it. Pulling and pushing mana both have a shared maximum per round equal to your MA.

{% include example.html content="For Example, Ceil has an MA of 50. In a single round, she can push 20 mana to Balrog and pull 30 mana from her Mana Battery. She must be in contact with both Balrog and the Mana Battery at some point during the round. But since she took this intention, she cannot take any other Magic Intentions and thus cannot cast a spell." %}
