#### Stance: Alert to Danger {#alert-to-danger}
**Stance**: 1 AP

When you declare this intention, you prepare yourself for an unseen danger. While in this stance, you are alert, keeping your senses spread so as to not be surprised. You cannot be Surprised by danger that you cannot see. This does not prevent Surprise caused by an opponent who has a high Initiative. The first Opposed Skill Check you make against each creature suffers a -4 penalty, but opponents cannot gain the Surprise State over you by you being unaware.

If this is taken with the _Anticipate Surprise_ stance, you suffer a -4 to the first Opposed Skill Check you make against all creatures that you did not select and a -6 penalty to selected opponents.

Unlike other stances and intentions, this stance can be taken on your turn. This allows you to become alert to danger that you were previously not expecting.
