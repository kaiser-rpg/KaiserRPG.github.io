#### Stance: Alert to Danger {#alert-to-danger}
**Stance**: 1 AP

When you declare this intention, you prepare yourself for an unseen danger. While in this stance, you are alert, keeping your senses spread to not be surprised. You cannot be [@state Surprised @] by danger that you cannot see. This does not prevent [@state Surprise @] caused by an opponent who has a high [@skill Initiative @]. The first Opposed Skill Check you make against each creature suffers a `-4` deed penalty, but opponents cannot gain the [@state Surprise @] state over you by you being unaware.

If this is taken with the [@action Anticipate Surprise @] stance, you suffer a `-4` deed penalty to the first Opposed Skill Check you make against all creatures that you did not select and a `-6` deed penalty to selected opponents.

Unlike other stances and intentions, this stance can be taken on your turn. This allows you to become alert to danger that you were previously not expecting.
