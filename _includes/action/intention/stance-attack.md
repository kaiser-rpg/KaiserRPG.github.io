#### Stance: Total Attack {#total-attack}
**Stance**: 0 AP

When you declare this intention, you enter a state of pure offense. While in this stance, you gain a +3 to any Offensive Roll made as part of the _Attack Action_ and you do not lose any AP when hit by an attack. In return, your Defensive Rolls are zero. When you receive a Critical, you still lose AP as per the Critical's level. If you have the Rex Damage Role, while in this stance you lose your Absorption.

This stance cannot be combined with _Absorb Hits_ or _Total Defense_ stances.
