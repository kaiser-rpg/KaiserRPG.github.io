#### Stance: Total Attack {#total-attack}
**Stance**: 0 AP

When you declare this intention, you enter a state of pure offense. While in this stance, you gain a `+3` deed bonus to any Offensive Roll made as part of the [@action Attack Action @] and you do not lose any AP when hit by an attack. In return, you do not roll dice for your Defensive Rolls. When you receive a Critical, you still lose AP as per the Critical's Level. If you have the Rex Damage Role, while in this stance you lose your Absorption.

This stance cannot be combined with [@action Absorb Hits @] or [@action Total Defense @] stances.
