### Charging Attack
**Intention**: Weapon Cost + 3 AP

The charging attack intention allows you to perform the Attack Action once this round after you run towards your opponent. When you take this intention, you must chose one or more weapons that you plan to use this round. The weapon with the worst Initiative Penalty is applied to your Initiative Roll and the highest Weapon Cost is used to determine the AP cost of this Intention. You also count as having took the Run intention, the AP cost is included in this intention.

When it is your turn, you move directly towards an opponent. If you moved at least 20 feet, your hand-to-hand weapon's Offensive Roll gains one degree of Advantage and a +1 to its Base Damage. But, you suffer one degree of Disadvantage on Block Checks. You also gain any benefit your mount provides as part of a Charging Attack.

Unlike the Attack Intention, this intention does not let you perform additional Attack Actions in a single round. But you have have sufficient skill, you gain one more degree of Advantage and +1 Base Damage for every 10 points you have in your Final Strike Skill (and for each Additional Attack Module you purchased).
