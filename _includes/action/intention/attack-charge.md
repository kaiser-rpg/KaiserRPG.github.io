### Charging Attack
**Intention**: Weapon Cost + 3 AP

The _Charging Attack_ intention allows you to perform the _Complete Attack_ once this round after you run towards your opponent. When you take this intention, you must chose one hand-to-hand weapon that you plan to use this round. You also count as having took the Run intention, the AP cost is included in this intention.

When it is your turn, you must move directly towards an opponent. If you moved at least 20 feet, your hand-to-hand weapon's Offensive Roll gains one degree of Advantage and a +1 to its Base Damage. But, you suffer one degree of Disadvantage on Block Checks until the End Phase. You also gain any benefit your mount provides as part of a _Charging Attack_.

Unlike the _Attack_ intention, this intention does not let you perform additional _Attack Actions_ in a single round. But if you have sufficient skill, you gain one more degree of Advantage and +1 Base Damage for every 5 points you have in your Final Strike Skill (and for each Additional Attack module you purchased).
