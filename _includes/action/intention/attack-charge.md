### Charging Attack
**Intention**: Weapon Cost + 3 AP

The [@action Charging Attack @] intention allows you to perform the [@action Complete Attack @] once this round after you run towards your opponent. When you take this intention, you must chose one hand-to-hand weapon that you plan to use this round. You also count as having took the [@action Run @] intention, the AP cost is included in this intention.

When it is your turn, you must move directly towards an opponent. If you moved at least 20 feet, your hand-to-hand weapon's Offensive Roll gains `A1` and a `+1` to its Base Damage. But, you suffer `D1` on [@skill Block @] Checks until the End Phase. You also gain any benefit your mount provides as part of a [@action Charging Attack @].

Unlike the [@action Attack @] intention, this intention does not let you perform additional [@action Attack Actions @] in a single round. But if you have sufficient skill, you gain one more degree of Advantage and `+1` Base Damage for every 4 points you have in your Final Strike Skill -- if you have purchased the Additional Attack module, you count as having 10 more in your Final [@skill Strike @] Value.
