### Magic
**Intention**: 2 AP

The _Magic_ intention allows you to manipulate mana, whether that be accumulation or transfer. There are four _Magic_ intentions and each round you can only take one of them. The four options are _Accumulate Pure Mana_, _Accumulate for a Prepared Spell_, _Cast an Innate Spell_, and _Transfer Mana_.
