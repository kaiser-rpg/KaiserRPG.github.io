#### Phenom Intention: Concentrate on Manifesting

When you declare this intention, you must also declare a phenom. You then focus on manifesting that phenom. Next round when you take the _Manifest Phenom_ intention, you gain a `+1` deed bonus to the [@skill Potential @] Check the first time you try to manifest the chosen phenom that round. If you take this intention for three rounds in a row, you gain a `+2` deed bonus. Five rounds will grant you a `+3` deed bonus. Ten rounds will grant `+4` deed bonus. If you do not use the phenom before the End Phase, the deed bonus is lost.
