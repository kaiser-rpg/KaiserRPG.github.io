#### Conjure Intention: Banish

Banishing a creature requires you to use a totem as part of a ritual. This totem can take many forms but represents some form of knowledge or connection. It is possible to banish a creature with a totem not affiliated with it, but you suffer a `-5` deed penalty. Without any totem, it is completely impossible.

The Game Master will take the level of the creature being banished and consult the Conjuring Table to determine the Difficulty of the Skill Check and how much mana you must expend. The Skill Check is made before the mana is spent. Mana spent on banishing does not need to be accumulated since it is removed directly from your Mana Pool. The Game Master can keep the level of the creature hidden until the Skill Check is made.

If you gain at least 1 Degree of Success on the [@skill Banish @] Difficulty Check, the creature starts to slip back to the Veil. To completely send it back, you require 2 DoS for every 10% of its LP it has remaining. So a creature at full Life Points would require 20 Degrees of Success while a creature at 30% would only require 6 DoS. If you do not gain enough DoS to banish it, you still cause the creature to have one fewer AP next round and you can continue the ritual to try again next turn. You still spend mana even if you gain 1 DoS but do not control it.

If you summoned the creature then you have `A4` on the Skill Check. If you summoned the creature and it is willing to be banished, you automatically pass and the creature is banished. You cannot control a creature to want to be banished and once it is banished the control stops working.

If you fail the Skill Check, compare your Degree of Failure with the Failed Conjuration Table.

Once you have banished the creature, you can choose to seal the creature there for a period of time. This would prevent the creature from returning to the world, if it has a natural means of doing so, and make it harder to summon. For every two Degrees of Success, you prevent the creatures return for one week and increase the Difficulty Skill Check to summon it by one for the same length of time.
