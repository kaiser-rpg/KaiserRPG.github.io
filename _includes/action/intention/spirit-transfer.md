#### Sprit Intention: Transfer Ki

When you declare this intention, as a Swift Action you can push an amount of ki, up to the sum of your chakras, from your Reserve to that of another. This transference requires you to be in direct contact with the creature or object with a Ki Reserve. You can transfer ki to several different targets as long as the total ki transferred out of your Reserve in a round is less than or equal to the sum of your chakras.

If you are in contact with a Ki Battery, you can instead pull ki from it. Pulling and pushing ki both have a shared maximum per round equal to the sum of your chakras.

To use this Intention, you must first have mastered the Ki Transfer Talent.
