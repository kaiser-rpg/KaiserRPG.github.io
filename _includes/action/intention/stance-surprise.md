#### Stance Intention: Anticipate Surprise {#anticipate surprise}
**Stance**: 1 AP

When you declare this intention, you prepare yourself for an exceptionally fast opponent. While in this stance, declare any number of opponents to anticipate their movements. The first Opposed Skill Check you make against each selected opponent suffers a -4 penalty, but the opponents cannot gain the Surprise State over you by having a high Initiative.

If this is taken with the alert to danger stance, you suffer a -4 to the first Opposed Skill Check you make against all creatures that you did not select and a -6 penalty to selected opponents.
