### Conjure
**Intention**: Complete AP

The _Conjure_ intention allows you manipulate the Veil by expending great deals of mana as part of a ritual. When you take this intention, you must declare what creature you wish to affect with your conjuring abilities. Then, you spend your entire turn performing the ritual. This ritual requires somatic and verbal components and cannot be done subtly.  You are unable to perform any other Intention or Active Actions while performing the ritual. You are still able to perform Swift Actions.

The ritual can be paused for one or more rounds and continued. If the ritual is paused by for more rounds than your Willpower Characteristic each hour, the ritual ends. Becoming Flat-Footed, not being in contact with the totem, the inability to perform the somatic and verbal components, or choosing not to take the Conjuration Intention counts as a paused round. 

On the round that you are ready, the conjuration occurs at the End Phase. When this happens, you will make your Difficulty Skill Check determined by the level of the creature, modified by the ritual and the totem. At this point, you can chose which conjuring abilities you will use. Each one will happen in the sequence that you choose. The usual combinations are choosing to summon and then control a creature. 

After using a conjure ability, you can chose to continue the ritual. You are not able to use the ritual to summon another creature, since the ritual is only for that exact creature, but you can use the ritual to attempt to control or banish it later.
