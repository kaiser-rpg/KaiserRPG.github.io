### Attack
**Intention**: Weapon Cost + 1 AP

The attack intention allows you to perform the Attack Action once this round. When you take this intention, you must chose one or more weapons that you plan to use this round. The weapon with the worst Initiative Penalty is applied to your Initiative Roll and the highest Weapon Cost is used to determine the AP cost of this Intention.

With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple Attack Actions each round. For every 10 points you have in your Final Strike Skill, you can perform the Attack Action an additional time. 

Each additional Attack Action is harder to aim properly, you suffer a -2 penalty to the Offensive Roll for each Attack Action made after the first. Some powers will grant you additional Attack Actions which may ignore the additional attack penalty.
