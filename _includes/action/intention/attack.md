### Attack
**Intention**: Weapon Cost + 1 AP

The _Attack_ intention allows you to perform the _Attack Action_ once this round. When you take this intention, you must chose one or more weapons that you plan to use this round. The weapon with the worst Initiative Penalty is applied to your Initiative Roll and the highest Weapon Cost is used to determine the AP cost of this Intention. If you declare more than one weapon, you also suffer a -1 penalty to Initiative.

With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple _Attack Actions_ each round. For every 10 points you have in your Final Strike Skill, you can perform the _Attack Action_ an additional time. 

Each additional _Attack Action_ is harder to aim properly, you suffer a -2 penalty to the Offensive Roll for each _Attack Action_ made after the first. Some powers will grant you additional _Attack Actions_ which may ignore the additional attack penalty.
