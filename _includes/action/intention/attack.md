### Attack
**Intention**: Weapon Cost + 1 AP

The [@action Attack @] intention allows you to perform the [@action Attack Action @] once this round. When you take this intention, you must chose one or more weapons that you plan to use this round. The weapon with the worst Initiative Penalty is applied to your Initiative Roll and the highest Weapon Cost is used to determine the AP cost of this intention. If you declare more than one weapon, you also suffer a -1 deed penalty to Initiative.

With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple [@action Attack Actions @] each round. For every 10 points you have in your Final [@skill Strike @] Value, you can perform the [@action Attack Action @] an additional time.
