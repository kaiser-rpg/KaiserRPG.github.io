#### Conjure Intention: Summon

Summoning a creature requires you to use a totem as part of a ritual. This totem can take many different forms but represents some form of knowledge or connection. It is possible to summon a creature with a totem not affiliated with it, but you suffer a -5 penalty. Without any totem, it is completely impossible.

The Game Master will take the level of the creature being summoned and consult the Conjuring Table to determine the Difficulty of the Skill Check and how much mana you must expend. The Skill Check is made before the mana is spent. Mana spent on summoning does not need to be accumulated since it is removed directly from your Mana Pool. The Game Master can keep the level of the creature hidden until the Skill Check is made.

If you gain at least 1 Degree of Success on the [@skill Summon @] Difficulty Check, then the creature starts to materialize in the spot the ritual was performed or in front of you. The creature will become fully summoned on the End Phase of the tenth turn after the summoning is complete. For each DoS on the Skill Check, you can reduce the time to materialize by one round, to a minimum of one round. While materializing, the creature is completely immune to damage unless the attack comes from a creature with Nornir of 35 or higher. While materializing, the creature can sense what is happening around it and can speak if it is capable of it.

If you fail to summon the creature, compare your Degree of Failure with the Failed Summoning Table.

Once the creature is summoned, it can start to take actions. The Game Master will control the creature and chose what its Intentions and Actions are each round. When you summon a creature, you can attempt to control it before it has fully materialized. Since you can use the ritual you performed to summon it, you can gain its modifiers again.
