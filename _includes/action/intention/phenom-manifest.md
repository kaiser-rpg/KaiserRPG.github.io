#### Phenom Intention: Manifest Phenom

When you declare this intention, you can manifest one or more phenom this round. In order to manifest a phenom, you make a special Skill Check using your Potential with the action type being determined by the phenom. Using your Final Skill Roll, determine the highest Degree of Difficulty that it beats and that you have mastered. The phenom then manifests at that Degree of Difficulty.

You can manifest more than one phenom this round. But doing so causes you to split your Potential. You can divide your Final Potential Value between multiple phenom, but you must give each Skill Check at least 1 point. This division must be declared before making your roll. Once you have used all your Potential, you cannot manifest any more phenom this round.

{% include example.html content="Sarah has a Final Potential Value of 5. So in a single round, she could manifest one phenom with a +5 to the Skill Check. Or, she could manifest three phenom, two of them with a +2 and the last one with a +1." %}
