### Move
**Active**: 3 AP

Once you take this action, you can move a distance up to what your Movement Value allows. This movement can be used at any point during your turn, even if you delay or take other actions between moving. You can only take this action once per round. If you become effected by a power that increases or decreases your Movement Value, it can increase or decrease your remaining movement.
