### Defend with a Supernatural Barrier
**Swift**: 0+ AP

When you take this action, yu use a supernatural barrier that you have created to perform a Defensive Roll with the skill listed by the power. For the purpose of penalties and bonuses, this method of defense is blocking the source of the attack with a shield. If you successfully block the attack, the barrier takes damage equal to the Base Damage times ten, and an additional Base Damage for each point of AV the attack ignores. When blocking an area attack, the traits your defense and the area attack possess will determine how it resolves, but generally having the [@trait Imbued @] trait allows you to block normally. While you are considered to be using a shield, it is only for the purpose of defending against projectiles. You do not gain the bonus using a shield.

If the barrier's Life Points are reduced to zero, any remaining damage is dealt to you or whomever is protected by the barrier. You reduce the damage you take by 1 for every point of AV you possess against its Damage Type. If you have any Damage Negate or Damage Resistance, you only reduce the damage taken, and not the Base Damage.
