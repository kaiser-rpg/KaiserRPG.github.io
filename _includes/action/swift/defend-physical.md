### Defend with Block or Dodge
**Swift**: 0 AP

When you take this action, you perform a Defensive Roll with your Block or Dodge Skills. If you are wielding a shield, you can add its bonus to Block, or half its bonus to Dodge. Additionally, a shield reduces penalties with blocking projectiles.

When using Dodge against an area attack, you suffer a -8 penalty unless you can take the _Step_ special action to move out of the area of the attack. When Blocking an area attack, the traits your defense and the area attack possess will determine how it resolves, but generally having the Imbued trait allows you to block normally.

If you are subject to multiple attacks in a single round, it becomes harder to defend yourself with each successive attack. You suffer a -2 penalty for each attack after the first when using this action. This penalty cannot exceed -10, after 6 attacks.
