### Use a Swift Power
**Swift**: 0+ AP

In order to use a power with the Swift action requirement, you must perform this action. If the power does not mention an AP cost, the power can be used at no cost.

If you are subjected to the Surprise State, your ability to react with a swift power is reduced. Spells and exploits can only use half of the total accumulated mana or ki. Manifesting a phenom only allows you to use half of your maximum [@skill Potential @], the remaining [@skill Potential @] can be used later as per [@skill Potential @] Skill.
