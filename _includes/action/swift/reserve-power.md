### Reserve Power
**Swift**: 0 AP

You can spend Stamina to quickly restore some of your power. In order to use this, your Life Points must be less than half your maximum or you must be in a deadly situation that could be prevented by gaining the points from this feature.

When you take this action, you can spend 20 Stamina points to regain half of your total ki, mana, or PP.

Once this is used, it cannot be used again until at least two weeks of downtime have passed.
