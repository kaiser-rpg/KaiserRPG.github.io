### Second Wind
**Swift**: 0 AP

In intense situations, where you have been nearly defeated, you can spend Stamina to gain a second wind. In order to use this, your Life Points must be less than half your maximum. 

When you take this action, you can spend 15 Stamina Points to regain half of your maximum LP.

Once this is used, it cannot be used again until at least two weeks of downtime have passed.
