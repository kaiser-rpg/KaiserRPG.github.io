### Hidden Power
**Swift**: 0 AP

You can spend Stamina to use a power that is hidden inside you. In order to use this, you Life Points must be less than half your maximum or you must be in a deadly situation that could be prevented by shortly having the hidden power.

When you take this action, you can spend 10 Stamina points to gain access to an ability for 1 minute. Each additional Stamina point spent gives you access to the ability for an additional minute. The ability you gain access to must be one that you will eventually purchase or have already spent some downtime learning.

Powers and features that can be revealed this way are left up to the Game Master, but for example you could gain access to a high level spell in a path, use a spirit technique within a tree you have started, or manifest a phenom within a discipline mastered.

Once this is used, it cannot be used again until at least two weeks of downtime have passed.
