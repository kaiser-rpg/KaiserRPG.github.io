### Prepare an Offensive Action
**Active**: 0 AP

When you take this action, you must choose a set of conditions and once those conditions are meet, you can perform an Offensive Roll that you had prepared. Until those conditions are met, you cannot use that Offensive Roll. You can end the condition with another Active Action, freeing the Offensive Roll.
