### Maintain Spirit
**Active**: 1 AP

When you take this action, you keep your focus on your ki and chakras. If you are maintaining any spirit abilities or techniques, and have not taken this action before the End Phase, all of your maintained spirit abilities and techniques end.

Minor and greater sustained abilities and techniques do not require you to take this action.
