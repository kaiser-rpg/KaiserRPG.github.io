### Delay Turn
**Active**: 0 AP

When you take this action, you end your turn. But as long as you are not Flat-Footed, you can resume your turn at the end of any other combatants turn. You can also choose to not resume your turn this round.

If you and another combatant both wish to resume at the same time, the one with the higher Initiative Roll this round can choose who goes first.
