### Attack
**Active**: 0 AP

When you take this action, you perform an Offensive Roll with your [@skill Strike @] Skill and one of your weapons. Attacks are modified by the hand-to-hand states or the ranged states depending on how your are using your weapon.

This action can only be taken once if you have taken the [@action Attack @] intention. With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple [@action Attack Actions @] each round. For every 10 points you have in your Final [@skill Strike @] Value, you can perform the [@action Attack Action @] an additional time each round. 

Each [@action Attack Action @] you take gives you a deed penalty to all subsequent [@action Attack Actions @]. You suffer a cumulative `-2` deed penalty when you attack with a weapon equal to your size. On the Intention Phase, this penalty resets to zero. For each size group smaller than you, the penalty is reduced by 1. So a medium creature using a small weapon only gains a `-1` penalty. Similarly, for each size group larger, the penalty increases by 1. So a medium creature using a large weapon suffers a `-3` and a huge weapon would cause a `-4` penalty. Some powers will grant you additional [@action Attack Actions @] which ignore the additional attack penalty.
