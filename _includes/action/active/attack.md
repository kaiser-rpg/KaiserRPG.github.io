### Attack
**Active**: 0 AP

When you take this action, you perform an Offensive Roll with your Strike Skill and one of your weapons. Attacks are modified by the hand-to-hand Situations or the Ranged Situations depending on how your are using your weapon.

This action can only be taken if you have taken the Attack Intention and once per round. With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple Attack Actions each round. For every 10 points you have in your Final Strike Skill, you can perform the Attack Action an additional time each round. 

Each Attack Action you take gives you a penalty to all subsequent Attack Actions. You suffer a cumulative -2 penalty when you attack with a weapon equal to your size. On the Intention Phase, this penalty resets to zero. For each size group smaller than you, the penalty is reduced by 1. So a medium creature using a small weapon only gains a -1 penalty. Similarly, for each size group larger, the penalty increases by 1. So a medium creature using a large weapon suffers a -3 and a huge weapon would cause a -4 penalty. Some powers will grant you additional Attack Actions which ignore the additional attack penalty.

| Size | Penalty per Add. Attack |
| One size smaller | -1 |
| Same size | -2 |
| One size larger | -3 |
| Two size larger | -4 |
