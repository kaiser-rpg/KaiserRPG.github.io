### Attack
**Active**: 0 AP

When you take this action, you perform an Offensive Roll with your Strike Skill and one of your weapons. Attacks are modified by the hand-to-hand Situations or the Ranged Situations depending on how your are using your weapon.

This action can only be taken once if you have taken the _Attack Intention_. With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple _Attack Actions_ each round. For every 10 points you have in your Final Strike Skill, you can perform the _Attack Action_ an additional time each round. 

Each _Attack Action_ you take gives you a penalty to all subsequent _Attack Actions_. You suffer a cumulative -2 penalty when you attack with a weapon equal to your size. On the Intention Phase, this penalty resets to zero. For each size group smaller than you, the penalty is reduced by 1. So a medium creature using a small weapon only gains a -1 penalty. Similarly, for each size group larger, the penalty increases by 1. So a medium creature using a large weapon suffers a -3 and a huge weapon would cause a -4 penalty. Some powers will grant you additional _Attack Actions_ which ignore the additional attack penalty.
