### Offhand Attack
**Active**: 0 AP

This action can only be taken after using your main weapon to make an _Attack Action_ and you have a weapon in your offhand. Both weapons must be held in one hand. When you take this action, you perform an Offensive Roll with your offhand weapon. The Offensive Roll is made with your Strike Skill but suffers a -4 penalty. 

This special action can be taken even if you have attacked your maximum number of times and it does not count as an additional _Attack Action_. No matter your skill, you can only take this action once each round.
