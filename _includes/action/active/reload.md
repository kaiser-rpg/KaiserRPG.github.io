### Reload
**Active**: 1 AP

When you take this action, you prepare a ranged weapon you have at the ready for another attack. This action covers grabbing a piece of ammunition, loading it, and preparing the firing mechanism. Once you have performed a number of [@action Reload @] actions on a fired weapon, it is ready and can be used as part of the [@action Attack Action @].

This action can only be taken once per round. For every 10 points you have in your Final [@skill Strike @] and [@skill Sleight of Hand @] Values, you reduce the number of Reloads a weapon requires by one. If you reduce the Reload to zero, you can reload the weapon as part of an Offensive Roll and you do not need to perform the [@action Reload @] action.
