### Dash
**Active**: 3 AP

When you take this action, you gain a Movement Distance equal to your Dash Distance. This movement is can be used by taking the _Move_ or _Step_ actions. You can only take this action once per round and only if you have not taken the _Run_ or _Sprint_ intentions. If you become effected by a power that increases or decreases your Movement Value, it can increase or decrease your remaining Distance.
