### Attack
**Active**: 0 AP

When you take this action, you perform an Offensive Roll with one of your weapons. The Offensive Roll is made with your Attack Skill. Attacks are modified by the Hand-to-hand Situations or the Ranged Situations depending on how your are using your weapon.

This action can only be taken if you have taken the Attack Intention and once per round . With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple Attack Actions each round. For every 10 points you have in your Final Attack Skill, you can perform the Attack Action an additional time. 

Each additional Attack Action you take each round, it becomes harder to aim properly. You suffer a -2 penalty to the Offensive Roll for each Attack Action made after the first. Some powers will grant you additional Attack Actions which may ignore the additional attack penalty.
