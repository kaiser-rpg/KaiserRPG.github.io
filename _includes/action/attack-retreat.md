### Attack a Retreating Creature
**Reaction**: 1 AP

This action can only be taken when a creature attempts to retreat after engaging in hand-to-hand combat. When you take this action, you can perform the Attack Action against the retreating opponent. The Attack Action must use a hand-to-hand weapon and cannot be used to perform a maneuver. The creature suffers the Flanked Situation and every Degree of Success reduces their remaining movement distance by ten feet.

If a creature has Surprise over you, you are unable to attack them. Additionally, this does not allow you to hit a creature as it moves past you. You must have been in hand-to-hand combat with them previously. To hit a creature moving past you, you have to prepare an Attack Action.
