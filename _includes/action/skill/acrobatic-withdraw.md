### Withdraw (Acrobatics)
**Special**: 1 AP, part of moving

When you take this action, you attempt to withdraw from hand-to-hand combat, even against several adversaries at once, by jumping over one of them or by tumbling past them. To do this, you must have the ability to act. In such a moment, you perform an Opposed Skill Check using your Acrobatics Skill against the Strike Skill of all opponents within hand-to-hand weapon range. If you gain 4 DoS, you have succeeded in fleeing from the hand-to-hand combat without permitting that opponent to attack you as a retreating creature. With less than 4 DoS, your opponent has intercepted your escape. If you fail, your opponent gains the ability to make a Counter against you, gaining their DoS as a Counter bonus.

This action only has to be taken once each round and you use same Acrobatic Skill Roll for every opponent you leave hand-to-hand combat. An opponent with no Attack Actions remaining cannot roll; an opponent can choose to not roll.
