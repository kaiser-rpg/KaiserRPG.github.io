### Aim
**Active**: 3 AP

When you take this action, you take time to line up your next projectile attack, giving you one degree of Advantage. Aiming at a target requires you to keep it within line of sight until you fire the projectile. If you lose sight of the target, even for a second, you lose all bonuses from aiming. Aiming for multiple rounds gives you an additional degree of Advantage, to a maximum of three.

This action can only be taken once per round and not on the same round that you perform an Attack Action.
