### Disable
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you strike at your opponent with non-lethal force with the intent of disabling them. Common methods of disabling are breaking an arm or cutting your opponents tendons. You make an Offensive Roll, using the Directed Attack penalties, against your opponent's arm or leg. The Final Damage of the attack is reduced by half. However, the Game Master should consider the full Final Damage and the designated arm or leg to be considered a vulnerable point to determine if a Critical occurs. 

This maneuver can be performed with any kind of single target and non area attack power. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll. Disable does not work against creatures with Damage Resistance.
