### Trapping
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to pin your opponent. You make an Offensive Roll with a -4 penalty. The Trapping maneuver does not cause the defender to take any damage.

If you gain 1 or more Degrees of Success on the Opposed Skill Check, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained less than 10 DoS on the Opposed Skill Check, you suffer a -3 penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained 20 or more DoS, you gain a +3 to the Opposed Characteristic Check. 

You can choose either Strength or Dexterity, while the defender choses between Strength, Dexterity, or Agility. Compare the Degrees of Success to the table below for the result of the Trapping.

If your opponent is successful on the Opposed Characteristic Check, they may instead Trap you. Their Degrees of Success are reduced by 10 and then compared to the Trapping Table. This does not cost your opponent any Action Points.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand attacks. You must declare that you will use this maneuver before making your Offensive Roll.

In order to maintain a trap, you must take an Active Action costing 2 AP on each round after the first. Failing to perform this action before the End Phase allows the opponent a free Opposed Characteristic Check with a +10 bonus. While trapping your opponent, you are unable to move freely, applying the Partially Restrained Situation to all your actions. Every Offensive or Defensive Roll you perform allows your opponent a free Opposed Characteristic Check, even if Fully Restrained. 

In order to free themselves, a Partially or Mostly Restrained opponent, as an Active Action costing 2 AP, attempt a new Opposed Characteristic Check with a -3 penalty. The opponent can only take that action once. If they do not take the action to free themselves, they get a free Opposed Characteristic Check, still with the -3 penalty, during the End Phase. A Fully Restrained opponent is unable to attempt to free themselves, unless you perform Attack Actions or do not take the action to maintain the trap.

Once you have an opponent trapped, you gain additional actions you can perform.
