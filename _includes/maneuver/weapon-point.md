### Put at Weapon's Point
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you use this maneuver, you attempt to "get the drop" on your opponent by putting your weapon in a position where it could easily kill them (for instance, a knife at their throat) but without causing them damage. You make an Offensive Roll with a -10 penalty. If you obtain at least 1 Degree of Success, you gain the At Weapon's Point State over your opponent, but you deal no damage.

With the At Weapon's Point State over your opponent, at any point later you can perform the Attack Action as a Swift Action. Once used to attack, the opponent loses the At Weapon's Point State. If an opponent has the Surprise State over you, they can perform their actions before you can take the Swift Action to attack. This can allow the opponent At Weapon's Point to escape.

This maneuver can only be performed with hand-to-hand weapons. If the Game Master permits, you can declare that you will use this maneuver after making your Offensive Roll but before the Defensive Roll's results are announced.
