Illusions are a false sensory stimulus produced by a power. The illusion can alter a targets sense of sight, touch, smell, hearing, taste, spatial awareness, passage of time, balance, pain, temperature, and body awareness just to name a few. Illusions can even modify a target's senses on other planes, like spirits, mana, and phenom. More complex illusions can alter multiple senses at one time, giving a fuller, more convincing, reality. 

Powers that produce illusions have two qualities that affect how they are interacted with. The type of illusions determines how it alters the perception of others. Control governs how you can shape the information after the power is activated. The combination of these two qualities will help you and the Game Master determine how the illusion interacts with other creatures.

## Type
The type of illusion determines how it alters the perceptions of creatures and part of the rules to discover it.

### Figment
Figments allow you to create new sensory information that you project into the world. Once a creature is aware of the false information, the figment becomes semi-transparent or faded out allowing them to ignore it without issue. A [@skill Notice @] or [@skill Search @] Check with a Degree of Difficulty set by the power can be used to determine the nature of the information. A creature can also be informed of the falsehood of a visual illusion if it is intercepted with an object and does not react as expected. If the creature is informed of the illusion by another, the illusion is not broken, but the [@skill Notice @] and [@skill Search @] Degree of Difficulty is halved. The [@skill Notice @] Check can only be performed when first seeing the Figment and each time the creature is given a reason to doubt it.

A Figment is not capable of dealing phantasmal damage since its nature is revealed when the attack land. But that does not mean that you cannot use them to attack while a creature believes in it.

### Glamor
Glamors allow you to change or hide some already existing sensory information. The creature can attempt a [@skill Notice @] or [@skill Search @] Check with a Degree of Difficulty set by the power to detect the illusion. But unlike Figments, Glamors do not disappear or become transparent after being detected.

A Glamor is not capable of dealing phantasmal damage since its nature is revealed when the attack land. But that does not mean that you cannot use them to attack while a creature believes in it.

{% include meta.html content="The major difference between Figments and Glamors is how they produce new information and what happens when it is discovered. Figments can only add things and that thing essentially disappears once its nature is discovered. So you cannot use a Figment to turn something invisible, but you could use it to create the image of a boulder that you hide inside. On the other hand, a Glamor can turn something invisible since it can remove information. Alternatively, that boulder is still an illusion, but is a visual impediment even if someone knows it is an illusion. Most examples will be for visual illusions since that is the easiest to demonstrate." %}

### Phantasm
Phantasms are the most power type of illusion and cannot be ignored simply as it exists in the mind of an affected creature. Since this type exists only in the mind, it can only be overcome with a Resistance Check. A new check is allowed when the power allows. Being informed of the illusionary nature does not cause the power to end, only granting `A2` on the Resistance Check.

Only Phantasms can be used to deal phantasmal damage since they exist in the mind, which can make a creature think they are hurt. Damage inflicted this way uses the Damage Type that the creature believes they are being hit with, applying all armor, resistances, and vulnerabilities. But once the illusion is broken, the damage done is reduced to a tenth of what they took. If the creature were to be reduced to zero Life Points from phantasmal damage, they are instead left unconscious. But if phantasmal damage were to produce a Critical that would kill them, they may still die of shock.

{% include meta.html content="The sense of touch is probably the hardest sense to conceptualize how it can be tricked. Visual Figments and Glamors can be moved through and adding a sense of touch would not change that -- at most it would allow someone to believe there is a texture before they move through it. As a result, most powers that can create touch illusions are Phantasms since your mind does the rationalization and you would be prevented from moving through it. The Game Master and the player need to be on the same page for how they react to an illusion." %}

## Control
The control of an illusion lets you change the shape of the illusion after it has been created. This control can make the illusion more believable as it can react as expected.

### Static
Static means that once the illusion is created, you have no ability to change it or move it. The illusion itself is simple, being unable to move or change. You can create humanoid shapes but they are unable to move, making the [@skill Notice @] and [@skill Search @] Check to detect their illusion halved. Static illusions are usually of the Figment type, but some Glamors are static as well such as Invisibility.

### Programmed
Programmed allows you to set up some general instructions that the illusion will follow. Examples of these instructions are distracting the guards, walk around the garden, or sleep. The illusion is unable to make decisions, so it cannot be programmed to be a lookout. Any Skill Check that the illusion would make uses your Final Skill Value. Programmed illusions can be any type, but usually are a Figment.

### Active
Active allows you to use your actions to change the shape of the illusion, such as causing it to walk or dodge attacks. Any Skill Check that the illusion would make uses your Final Skill Value. You share Action Points and any limited actions with the illusion as well, such as declaring the [@action Run @] action, taking [@action Attack Actions @] and penalties to multiple [@skill Blocks @] and [@skill Dodges @]. Active illusions can be any type, but are usually Phantasms.

### Sentient
Sentient gives you complete control over the actions of the illusion since it possesses a copy of your consciousness. Any Skill Check that the illusion would make uses your Final Skill Value. But, unlike Active, the illusion and you do not share Action Points or limited actions. Sentient illusions can be any type, but are usually Phantasms.
