In Kaiser, there are many different abilities and features that grant you special powers. Powers can come from many different sources, such as spirit, mana, and phenom, but they share many similar rules. These rules are described below.

## Types of Powers
Below are the types of powers that you can find in Kaiser. The description of each type includes how to use your Offensive or Defensive Skills (if required) and if the power can be seen on the material plane.

### Attack
Powers of this type allow you to perform an Offensive Roll against a target (or targets) using the appropriate Offensive Skill. This power is equivalent to a thrown projectile attack. The Base Damage is determined by the power and the Maximum Distance is based on your Offensive Skill or is listed in the powers description. 

Attack powers can be seen on the material plane.

For making offensive rolls, go to the [Attacking and Defending](rule_combat_attack_defend.html) section in the Combat Chapter.

### Defense
Defense powers allow you to use an appropriate Defensive Skill to prevent certain attacks, depending on the what the Power allows. Most Defense powers create a supernatural barrier. Powers that do not create supernatural barriers will list how to defend with them.

Defense powers are visible on the material plane.

For making defensive rolls, go to the [Attacking and Defending](rule_combat_attack_defend.html) section in the Combat Chapter.

### Effect
Powers of this type target an aspect of a creature. You use an appropriate Offensive Skill to aim and strike the target. The target applies their Absorption and AV — usually Force. If you obtain at least one Unit of Damage, then you cause the target to make a Resistance Check listed by the power. Gaining additional Units of Damage have no effect on the Resistance Check.

Effect powers never deal damage from the Offensive Roll — unless the power is also of the Attack Type. The power will list if it has the immaterial or imbued traits. 

Effect Powers are equivalent to a thrown projectile. If the power has the immaterial trait, then it cannot be seen on the material plane; the power will list what vision is required to not apply the Blind Penalty to defend. Powers that belong to both Attack and Effect are visible on the material plane regardless of the immaterial trait. 

For making offensive rolls, go to the [Attacking and Defending](rule_combat_attack_defend.html) section in the Combat Chapter. Remember that effect powers are a special type of attack that does not produce damage from the Offensive Roll.

### Automatic
Powers of this type produce automatic effects on you, another creature, or the environment. They usually produce beneficial effects. The maximum distance will be listed or is determined by an appropriate Offensive Skill and you do not require an Offensive Roll unless the target is in a difficult position. If no Resistance Check Difficulty is listed, the target can resist with a SR 8 Check. 

Automatic powers usually have the immaterial trait. As with Effect powers, if they have the immaterial trait then the power is not visible on the material plane. But the after-effect can be material, like shedding light or healing wounds.

### Trigger
Powers of this type have certain triggering conditions and do not require Offensive Skills for range or aim. Any target who meets the conditions automatically suffer the effects of the power. 

Trigger powers are frequently Effect as well, in this case the target makes the Resistance Check when the triggering condition is meet. A target who passes the Resistance Check is immune to the Power's Resistance Check for a number of rounds equal to their Degree of Success. Once the immunity ends and the conditions are meet again, the target must make another Resistance Check.

Some trigger powers can have a center point other than you. The center can be placed anywhere within range of your Offensive Skill. You may require an Offensive Roll if the target is in a difficult position.

Trigger powers usually have the immaterial trait. As with Effect powers, if they have the immaterial trait then the power is not visible on the material plane. But the after-effect can be material, like shedding light or healing wounds.

### Detection
Powers of this type are a special type of trigger power. The trigger is being within range and it allows you to gain information, whether that be location, condition, or features, of any target that fails the Resistance Check. Detection powers can be negated by some powers and a target gets a bonus to the Resistance Check based on their Conceal Ki Skill if they have developed it.

### Passive
Powers of this type have their effects always active. The power might still allow you to suppress the power and reactivate it later, in which case it is a Swift Action to turn off and back on.

## Powers and Actions
When you wish to use a power, you must take the appropriate action to activate it. Consult the following table for how to activate each action requirement. 
<!-- If the power has an action requirement of Active, Swift, or Reaction, you can use it by taking the appropriate action. The action requirement of Attack can be used during the [Attack Action](todo.html), this is a special action requirement since it counts toward the multiple attack penalty. Similarly,  The action requirement of Complete is another special one, requiring that you declare its use during the Intention Phase and the power will not take full effect until the End Phase, any cost is spent at the end of the Intention Phase, after all accumulations have occurred. -->
