It is possible for two powers or supernaturally charged objects to collide with one another. The results of the collision will depend on the strength of the colliding projectiles. To create a collision, you must meet three criteria: you have to take the [@action Collide Power @] reaction, be in a position and have the ability to make a parallel shot, and have an [@skill Initiative @] within 5 points of the opponent that launched the original projectile, or surpass their [@skill Initiative @]. Then you use a ranged attack power (or shoot a supernaturally charged projectile as a Reaction) at the opposing power. You make an Offensive Roll and the result must be within 5 points of the opposing roll, or surpass it. If you achieve this result, then both you and the opponent roll 2d6 and add the Base Damage of the Power. The Degree of Difference (DoD) is compared to the below table.

It is possible to have two or more powers combine during a collision. The value added to the Collision roll is the highest Base Damage of the combined Powers, and then half the second greatest, and a third of the third greatest, and so on.
