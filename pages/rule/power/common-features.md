Many powers share similar features. Below are some general rules that are described below to either clarify or provide some further detail.

## Immaterial
Ghosts, spirits, and other creatures that do not fully exist on the material plane have a trait called immaterial. This trait gives them the ability to ignore material objects like weapons, armor, and shields; this can make them difficult or impossible to fight.

In order to hit a creature with the immaterial trait, your attack must have the imbued trait and a presence equal to or greater than that of the creature. All attacks that deal damage from the Energy Group naturally have the imbued trait. For Physical and Elemental damage, you need to gain the imbued trait from some other feature, ability, or power. Whether a power, dealing damage from the Resistance Group, is imbued will be listed in the power's description.

Similarly, a creature with the immaterial trait will make its attacks immaterial as well. To defend against such an attack, you must either dodge or block it with an imbued object.

The talent of Presence Extrusion allows you to grant the imbued trait to your weapons and give them a presence equal to twice yours. The meta magic ability Imbued Spell allows your attack and defense spells to gain the imbued trait. A phenom will list at what degree it gains the imbued trait. Some artifacts can also give you or your powers the imbued trait as well.

## Area Attack
Some powers have the ability to affect a large area with a single attack. This area attack can take many different shapes: sphere, cylinder, cone, line, and so on. Each valid target within the volume of the attack must make a Defensive Roll against your Offensive Roll (only one roll). The area attack will still count as a thrown projectile for the purpose of defense.

A target can dodge out of the area of the attack by taking the Step special action to move outside the area of the attack. if they have enough movement remaining to reach a point outside the volume of the attack. The target still makes a Defensive Roll against the attack even if they can move out of its area. If they are unable to reach a safe point for whatever reason, they apply a -8 penalty to the Defensive Roll.

The ability to block an area attack depends on the traits that the area attack and the target's defense possess. How each trait affects the defense of a target is described with the trait. In general, having an imbued defense will allow the target to defend normally.

## Affected Presence
All objects and creatures have a certain amount of essence in the world, measured by their presence. Some powers are only able to affect a certain sum of presence. In these cases, the sum of the affected presence must be equal to or less than the listed presence. 

In general, the presence of equipment, cloths, and even most artifacts do not need to be included when determining affected presence as long as it is on the target's person.

For example, if you were to cast the spell Invisibility at the Base Degree you can affect a maximum of 10 presence. So, you can target three creatures with 3 presence each, two creatures with 5 presence each, or one creature with 6 presence and another with 4 presence. Anything the creature is carrying, that is also not sentient) does not count toward the presence total. So, a target holding a magic sword with the presence of 12 would still turn the sword invisible until they drop it. But since the sword has a presence higher than the spells affected amount the sword cannot be targeted.

## Target Selection
You are not able to specify targets for an area attack unless otherwise listed. If you are unaware of a creature's existence within the area, you cannot deselect them even if the power allows.

## Allowing the Effect
If the target desires to be affected by a power they are aware of, then they can choose to fail the Resistance Check. If the target has multiple personalities controlling it, then only if all the personalities agree can the target choose to fail. If for instance you are possessed by a spirit, the spirit and you may not both agree to being healed or being subject to a paralyzing power.

## Phantasmal Damage
Only Phantasm type illusions can be used to deal phantasmal damage since they exist in the mind, which can make a creature think they are hurt. Damage inflicted this way uses the Damage Type that the creature believes they are being hit with, applying all armor, resistances, and vulnerabilities. But once the illusion is broken, the damage done is reduced to a tenth of what they took. If the creature were to be reduced to zero Life Points from phantasmal damage, they are instead left unconscious. But if phantasmal damage were to produce a Critical that would kill them, they may still die of shock.

## Repeat Resistance Checks
When a power subjects a target to a Resistance Check that causes a lingering effect, the target gets a new Resistance Check after a number of rounds have passed equal to their Degree of Failure. If the power ends, either due to you no longer maintaining it or due to an external force, the effect also ends without the target having to make another Resistance Check.

## Marking
Some powers cause you to mark the target. The power will list how long a creature will remain marked. Marks usually occur as a result of an attack or effect power. What a mark does after being applied is listed with the power that caused it or in another related power.
