Some powers allow you to keep their effects activate for a long time. Each power that can be maintained has a cost that must be payed during the End Phase every increment of time. If you are unable to pay the cost, the power ends when the round does.

### Turn
Powers with a maintenance of Turn require you to pay their maintenance cost each round. 

### Minor Sustain
Powers with a maintenance of Minor Sustain, sometimes just called Minor, require you to pay their maintenance cost every minute (10 rounds).

### Major Sustain
Powers with a maintenance of Major Sustain, sometimes just called Major, require you to pay their maintenance cost every ten minutes (100 rounds).

### Daily
Powers with a maintenance of Daily require you to pay their maintenance cost every day at dawn. Also, unlike the other maintenance values, these powers can be maintained while asleep.
