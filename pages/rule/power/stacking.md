title: Stacking Effects of Powers

Many powers grant bonuses or penalties to any number of different abilities. How each ability handles multiple sources of increase and decrease is described below. In general, only take the best bonus and the worst penalty.

## Skill Bonus
A creature affected by multiple powers that give a direct bonus to Skill Checks only apply the best bonus. Powers that apply a State (which gives a bonus) or use a maneuver that applies a bonus are still added completely with the best direct bonus from a power.

## Skill Penalty
A creature affected by multiple powers that give a direct penalty to Skill Checks only apply the worst penalty. Powers that apply a State (which gives a penalty) or use a maneuver that applies a penalty are still added completely with the worst direct penalty from a power.

## Characteristic Bonus and Penalty
A Characteristic bonus or penalty will increase or decrease one of your Characteristics, such as Strength or Perception. Any bonus gained from multiple powers will only apply the greatest bonus. Any penalty gained from multiple powers will apply the worst penalty. 

Some powers allow you to sacrifice a point in a characteristic to gain some special benefit. When this is done, it reduces your base Characteristic, so it does not count as a penalty.
