Life Points are a representation of your sturdiness and resolve to live. By having more LP than another means that you can take a greater beating before your body gives out. A strike that might break the legs of creature with fewer LP might only cause you to stumble because you are more resistant to wounds. 

## Life
Life Points can be lost for many different reasons and how they affect your body is just as varied. Being stabbed in the stomach and being burned by fire will both reduce your Life Points, but one will cause you to bleed while the other sears your skin. Each time you are injured, you reduce your remaining LP by the Final Damage of whatever injured you. When your LP is less than or equal to zero, you fall unconscious.

## Between Life and Death
Once your LP falls below zero, you enter a state known as Between Life and Death. In this state, you lose 10 LP every hour (or 1 LP every 6 minutes) and can make a Presence Check of 12 to attempt to stabilize yourself at the end of the hour. If you ever fail with 6 Degrees of Failure you die.

Once you succeed, you no longer lose 10 LP every hour but are still unconscious. While in this stable state, you naturally recover LP as per your Regeneration Value. If you take any damage while in this state, you go back to Between Life and Death. While you are unconscious, you still require food and water and can be harmed by exposure to the element. If these needs are not meet, you start to suffer damage as per their rules. You can also be stabilized with a Medicine Skill Check of 8.

Once your LP is above 0, you regain consciousness â€“ although you have a -6 All Action Penalty. The penalty is reduced by what is stated in your Regeneration Value.

## Death
The most common way to die is by suffering enough damage that your body loses the will to continue. This occurs when your LP is at a negative value greater than half of your total LP. The other common way to die is when you suffer a sufficiently high-level Critical that causes your head to be amputated or your heart to fail. There are some other ways to die, like a spell effect causing immediate death or a phenom causing brain damage. But those methods have their own rules.

### Called Away
Either way, at the point of death your spirit leaves your body. Your spirit will remain for a number of hours equal to your Willpower multiplied by your Presence. When that time expires, your soul disappears into the Beyond and can only return by reincarnation. While waiting for the Beyond, your spirit will either remain with the body or in the place where you died, decided by the Game Master. Beings with unfinished business or a significant connection to a material object may be able to stay at the discretion of the GM.

## Recovery
If a wound did not kill you, you can recover from it. The rate of healing depends on the severity of the wound and your natural healing factor. Your healing factor is known as your Regeneration Value and is based on your Constitution.

### Regeneration
Your base Regeneration Value is equal to half your Constitution Characteristic. It is not necessary to reach Inhumanity to receive Regeneration of a Constitution greater than 10, but Regeneration Values above 20 are special and require sufficient Gnosis.

Below is a table for how much LP is recovered each day with the specified Regeneration Value. You can double your LP recovered by resting and receiving trained medical care and move as little as possible for an entire day. The table also shows the reduction in All Action penalties per day caused by Criticals or recovery from Between Life and Death. 

Lastly, sufficiently high Regeneration Values have special recovery physical or supernatural effects like reattaching limbs or creating a new body. You always gain the benefits of any lower Regeneration Value. A material creature has access to the physical benefits of Regeneration; the supernatural benefits require you to have certain traits or powers. 

In the case of creatures with Damage Resistance, the amount of LP healed is multiplied by their Damage Resistance Multiplier.

### Curse Damage
Some sources of supernatural damage cause lasting wounds that are difficult to heal. Life Points lost by these types of wounds are not recovered in the conventional way; they ignore Regeneration as well healing powers. These cursed Life Points recover at a rate equal to the average of your Constitution, Focus, and Willpower Characteristics per day.

In the case of creatures with Rex, the amount of cursed damage healed is multiplied by their Life Point Multiplier. Additionally, any willing curse damage (consumed by a power) are also multiplied by their LPM.
