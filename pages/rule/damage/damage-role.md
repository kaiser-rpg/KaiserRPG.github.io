A creature can utilize different methods of tracking if it is dead or not. The standard method of taking damage is outlined in previous sections. The alternate rules for Ludus and Rex are as follows.

## Ludus
The Ludus Damage Role allows you to ignore weaker attacks but fall with one good hit. This role uses the following changes to the Standard Damage Role.

1. Your maximum Life Points becomes 1. You cannot invest XP to increase your Life Points. No power can give you temporary LP or increase your maximum LP. As you have a single Life Point, any damage will cause you to suffer a Critical.

2. You do not lose AP when you hit or take damage. However, you are unable to perform the Counter Action or gain any Counter bonus. 

3. You gain a bonus to your Absorption and a natural armor value for all Damage Types determined by your Size.

4. You can invest XP to gain Final Damage Negates. Any FDN gained are not bypassed by [@trait Imbued @] attacks.

## Rex
If you use the Rex Damage Role, you soak up large amounts of damage due to your bulk and not your defensive capabilities. This role uses the following changes to the Standard Damage Role.

1. You multiple your maximum Life Points by the Life Point Multiplier (LPM) determined by your Size. So if you have 80 LP and a LPM of 5, your maximum Life Points become 400 LP. You also multiply any LP healed, either by a power or regeneration, by your LPM. Any Life Points sacrifices as part of a power is multiplied by your LPM.

2. You do not lose AP when you are hit by an attack. However, you are unable to perform the [@action Counter @] action or benefit from a Counter bonus. You can still lose AP from a Critical.

3. Your Defensive Roll is considered zero since you do not possess any defensive capability except what your armor and absorption grant. You cannot increase your Block or Dodge Skills. If a prerequisite requires an amount of Block or Dodge Skill, instead use your Strike Skill.

4. You gain a bonus to your Absorption and a natural armor value for all Damage Types determined by your Size.

5. You do not have any vital points and the Critical Level is reduced by half, even without reaching 20. If an attack would automatically cause a Critical, it instead counts as having hit a vital point.

6. You cannot use the [@action Total Attack @], [@action Total Defense @], [@action Absorb Hits @] stances. Additionally, the [@state Surprise @] state halves your Absorption instead of giving you a negative to your Defensive Roll.

7. If you receive an area attack that covers half your body, the Base Damage of the attack is doubled.

8. If you are covered by a supernatural barrier, either created by another creature or by your own power, the Defensive Roll suffers a `-8` deed penalty. As usual, you can choose to not benefit from the barrier. If the barrier breaks, you lose an AP point.
