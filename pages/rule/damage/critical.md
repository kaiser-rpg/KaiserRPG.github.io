It is inevitable that you suffer damage in combat. However, not all damage involves merely losing a set number of Life Points. When you receive a single wound that makes you lose half your remaining LP, you have received a Critical hit. 

{% include example.html content="An individual with 180 LP who receives a single hit that causes him to lose 90 or more Life Points has suffered a Critical. With his LP now reduced to 90, another hit causing just 45 LP more would cause another Critical."%}

Whenever you suffer a Critical, the possibility exists that a very serious wound will result in broken bones or even lost limbs. To find the result, it is necessary to calculate the level of the Critical. The attacker rolls 2d6 (no Open Rolls or Fumbles) and adds that to 1/10 the damage produced by the attack, round down. The result is the Critical level. Reduce any amount above 20 by half and add that to the total. Thus, the GM would reduce a Critical level of 26 to 23 (6/2 + 20) and a level of 31 to 25 (11/2 +20).

Then, you must a Physical Resistance Check against the level of the Critical. If your total is higher than the Critical, you pass the Resistance Check and suffers no further ill effects from the hit – other than the original Life Point damage. However, if you fail the PhR Check, the Degree of Failure determines the effects of the Critical.

## Effects of a Critical
In this section we will explain the different effects that Criticals can produce, as seen in the following table.

When you fail the PhR Check, you automatically suffer an All Action Penalty equal to the Degree of Failure. Additionally, you lose 1 AP for each DoF. 

If the DoF is 5 or less, the attack may have been painful, but it leaves nothing more than some bruises and a nice scar. You gain an All Action Penalty, caused by momentary shock and pain, not any lasting physical effects, and it disappears at a rate of 1 per round until it vanishes completely. It isn't necessary, therefore, to determine the location of the hit, because there are no additional effects.

If the DoF is greater than 6+, the damage you suffer involves something seriously incapacitating – like broken bones or joint dislocations. The Action Penalty will last until you recover based on your Regeneration Value. If the attack was not a Directed Attack, use the General Hit Location Table to decide the body part affected. If it hits the head, the combatant is automatically unconscious.

For a DoF higher than 11+, the attack has destroyed the part of the body that was hit. As before, the Action Penalty recovers as per the rules for Regeneration. If the part hit turns out to be an arm or leg, the GM should consider that limb useless – whether due to being crushed or otherwise heavily damaged – or even amputated. If the strike was a Directed Attack (not rolled randomly) at the heart or head (or some equally vulnerable part of a non-human's anatomy), you instantly lose consciousness and will die in a number of rounds equal to your Constitution, unless you receive medical attention with a Difficulty Check of 28. 

Finally, if DoF is above 16+, the effects are exactly as stated in the previous case, except that you also instantly lose consciousness, no matter where you were hit. While unconscious, you will die in a number of minutes equal to your Constitution, unless you receive medical attention with a Difficulty Check of 16.

Medical treatment required as a result of a Critical cannot be resolved by a simple healing power. Instead of causing you to gain LP, a healing power that does not also grant medical attention only prevents your death by a number of seconds equal to the LP to be recovered. If the healing power is used in conjunction with medical treatment, it does grant Advantage to the Difficulty Skill Check.

As always, creating an appropriately colorful description for Criticals is in the hands of the Game Master. If fighting occurs with creatures whose bodies are very different from those of humans, the GM might need to adjust the location of hits.

## Vulnerable Points
There are certain places on the body that are more vulnerable to Criticals than others. These vulnerable points are areas most sensitive to damage. If you receive a blow directed at a vulnerable point, losing a mere 10% of your current Life Points is enough to cause a Critical.

For any human, the head and heart are vulnerable points – although animals and supernatural creatures may not follow that pattern. Some entities, in fact, don't even have such weak points; hitting them for half their remaining LP is the only way to cause them a Critical.

{% include example.html content="With 160 LP and in perfect health, Klaus needs to lose 80 LP from a single hit to cause a Critical and make a PhR Check. But an attack directed at his head only needs to cause 16 points before he is forced to make such a check because his head is a vulnerable point."%}
