In Kaiser, there are twelve types of damage that an attack can use. These damages are sorted into four groups to handle broad references. The groups are Physical, Elemental, Energy, and Resistance. 

## Physical Damage
Damage in the Physical Damage Group are those done by physical objects, like weapons or rocks.

**Cut**: This damage is done by weapons moving in a slicing motion. Objects carried by strong winds and swinging axes are common sources of this damage type.

**Impact**: When you are struck by heavy blunt objects, or run into them, you take Impact Damage. Falling a great distance and Warhammers are common sources of this damage.

**Thrust**: Weapons that deal damage by impaling you deal Thrust damage. Spears and arrows are common sources of this damage.

## Elemental Damage
The Elemental Damage Group contains damage dealt by exposure to extreme elemental forces like fire.

**Heat**: This damage occurs when an attack produces an intense amount of damage. Standing inside a bonfire or being struck by a fire elemental are common sources of this type of damage.

**Cold**: Low temperatures cause this damage. The icy blast of a spell or the frost breath of a dragon are common sources of this damage.

**Electrical**: Being struck by lightning or an electrical discharge are common sources of this damage.

## Energy Damage
The Energy Damage Group is commonly caused by supernatural effects. Many spells use one of the damage types from this group.

**Force**: This damage comes from raw energy and is immaterial in nature. Bolts of magical energy and repulsive blasts are common sources of this damage type.

**Light**: Intense beams of light are common sources of this damage type.

**Dark**: Shadowy energies are common sources of this damage type.

## Resistance Group
Damage Types in this Group are usually only done as part of a failed Resistance Check. Armor against these types of damage only apply to a Resistance Check that deals their damage and not to the roll to be hit by an effect power.

**Atomic**: This is damage done at the atomic level. Your atoms being rearranged or acidic substances are common sources of this damage.

**Bio**: This type of damage is done on the cellular level. Things likes poisons, diseases, or strong basic substances breaking down cell walls are common sources of this damage type.

**Psychic**: This damage is one dealt directly to the mind. Psychic screams and mental torture are common sources of this type of damage. This is also the damage that most Illusions deal, but if the target is not aware of the illusory nature of an attack special rules apply that can be found in the Power Chapter.
