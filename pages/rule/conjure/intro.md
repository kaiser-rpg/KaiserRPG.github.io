Mana has a curious property that allows you to use your spirit as a sort of portal to bring forth creatures from Beyond the Veil. Opening this portal is no easy task, requiring a high deal of research and preparation to synchronize your spirit with the Veil. But, unlike casting spells, conjuring a creature does not require the Gift, only a strength of spirit and sufficient mana. Since the conjured creature is a being in and of itself, how it interacts with you and the world is up to it (and the Game Master). The ability to control a creature once in the world and send it back are other skills in the realm of a conjurer. Conjured creatures must have a strong connection to the Veil, so a creature that belongs to the world or who has lost its connection to the Veil are immune to conjuration abilities.
