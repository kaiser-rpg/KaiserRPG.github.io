Mana has a curious property to allow you to use your spirit as a sort of portal to bring forth creatures from beyond the Veil. Opening this portal is no easy task, requiring a high degree of knowledge and a great deal of time allow you to synchronize your spirit with the Veil. But, unlike spells, conjuring a creature does not require the Gift, only a strength of spirit and sufficient mana. Since that creature is a being in and of itself, how it will interact with the world, and with you, is up to it. The ability to control a creature once here and send it back are further skills that will aid you as you delve into Veil Conjuration. Creatures pulled this way have a strong connection to the Veil, meaning you are unable to conjure natural creatures or those who are no longer tied to the Veil.




### Conjure
Cost: Complete AP

The conjure intention allows you manipulate the Veil by expending great deals of mana as part of a ritual. When you take this Intention, you must declare what creature you wish to conjure. Then, you spend your entire turn performing the ritual. This ritual requires somatic and verbal components and cannot be done subtly. If you are unable to perform either component, the ritual is broken and you must start again. You are unable to perform any other Intention or Active Actions while performing the ritual. You are still able to perform Swift Actions. 

On the round that you are ready, the conjuration occurs on at the End Phase. When this happens, you will make your Difficulty Skill Check determined by the level of the creature, modified by the ritual. At this point, you can chose which conjuring abilities you will use. Each one will happen in the sequence that you choose. The usual combinations are choosing to summon and then control a creature. 

After using a conjure ability, you can chose to continue the ritual. You are not able to use the ritual to summon another creature, since the ritual is only for that exact creature, but you can use the ritual to make control or banish it later.

#### Conjure Intention: Summon 
When you wish to summon a creature, you must have started a ritual devoted to it. Unlike control and banish, summoning a creature requires you to first obtain a totem of it. This can take many different forms but represents some form of knowledge or connection. It is possible to summon a creature without a complete totem, but you suffer a -5 penalty. Without any part of a totem, it is completely impossible.

The Game Master will take the level of the creature being summoned and consult the Conjuring Table to determine the Difficulty of the Skill Check and how much mana you must expend. The Skill Check is made before the mana is spent. Mana spent on summoning does not need to be accumulated since it is removed directly from your Mana Pool. The Game Master can keep the level of the creature hidden until the Skill Check is made.

If you gain at least 1 Degree of Success on the Difficulty Check, then the creature starts to materialize in the spot the ritual was performed or in front of you. The creature will become fully summoned on the End Phase of the tenth turn after the summoning is complete. For each DoS on the Skill Check, you can reduce the time to materialize by one round, to a minimum of one round. While materializing, the creature is completely immune to damage unless the attack comes from a creature with Nornir of 35 or higher. While materializing, the creature can sense what is happening around it and can speak if it is capable of it.

If you fail to summon the creature, compare your Degree of Failure with the Failed Conjuration Table.

Once the creature is summoned, it can start to take actions. The Game Master will control the creature and chose what its Intentions and Actions are each round. When you summon a creature, you can attempt to control it before it has fully materialized. Since the it is the same ritual you performed to summon it, you gain its modifiers again.

#### Conjure Intention: Control 
When you wish to control a creature, you must have started a ritual devoted to it.

The Game Master will take the level of the creature being controlled and consult the Conjuring Table to determined the Difficulty of the Skill Check and how much mana you must expend. The Skill Check is made before the mana is spent. Mana spent on controlling does not need to be accumulated since it is removed directly from your Mana Pool. The Game Master can keep the level of the creature hidden until the Skill Check is made.

If you gain at least 1 Degree of Success on the Difficulty Check, the creature might start to lose its volition. To gain complete control, you require 1 DoS for every 10% of its LP it has remaining. So a creature at full Life Points would require 10 Degrees of Success while a creature at 30% would only require 3 DoS. If you do not gain enough DoS to control it, you still cause the creature to have one fewer AP next round and you can continue the ritual to try again next turn. You still spend mana even if you gain 1 DoS but do not control it.

If you fail the Skill Check, compare your Degree of Failure with the Failed Conjuration Table.

Once you have control, the creature does not entirely lose its free will, but it cannot refuse a command you give it. Commands are given through a spiritual connection so you and the creature do not have to be able to understand each other. But this connection is one way. You and the controlled creature always have an approximate knowledge of the distance and direction that seperate you. Each round that you control the creature, you must spend the same amount of mana that it cost to control it. Once each hour or when you give it a command that goes against its nature, the creature can try to break free. This requires you to make a new Control Skill Check, with no modifier based on the ritual. If you ever absorb mana from the controlled creature, the control immediatly ends. 

#### Conjure Intention: Banish
When you wish to banish a creature, you must have started a ritual devoted to it.

The Game Master will take the level of the creature being banished and consult the Conjuring Table to determined the Difficulty of the Skill Check and how much mana you must expend. The Skill Check is made before the mana is spent. Mana spent on banishing does not need to be accumulated since it is removed directly from your Mana Pool. The Game Master can keep the level of the creature hidden until the Skill Check is made.

If you gain at least 1 Degree of Success on the Difficulty Check, the creature starts to slip back to the Veil. To completely send it back, you require 2 DoS for every 10% of its LP it has remaining, doing so causes the creature to be sent back to the Veil immidialty. So a creature at full Life Points would require 20 Degrees of Success while a creature at 30% would only require 6 DoS. If you do not gain enough DoS to banish it, you still cause the creature to have one fewer AP next round and you can continue the ritual to try again next turn. You still spend mana even if you gain 1 DoS but do not control it.

If you summoned the creature then you have four degrees of Advantage on the Skill Check. If you summoned the creature and it is willing to be banished, you automatically pass and the creature is banished. You cannot control a creature to want to be banished and once it is banished the control stops working.

If you fail the Skill Check, compare your Degree of Failure with the Failed Conjuration Table.

Once you have banished the creature, you can choose to seal the creature there for a period of time. This would prevent the creature from returning to the world, if it has a natural means of doing so, and make it harder to summon. For every two Degrees of Success, you prevent the creatures return for one week and increase the Difficulty Skill Check to summon it by one for the same length of time.
