As mentioned in the Conjuring Intention, you must perform a ritual to either summon, control, or banish a creature from Beyond the Veil.

The amount of time you spend on this ritual will modify your Difficulty Skill Check.

Each ritual is different and might require expensive materials to be consumed while performing it. The Game Master will determine the cost for each ritual, but guidelines are provided later in this chapter. If a ritual is performed for longer than 18 hours, you can suspend it for a maximum of 8 hours as you sleep.
