In Kaiser, there are many different abilities and features that grant you special powers. Powers can come from many different sources, such as spirit, mana, and phenom, but they share many similar rules. These rules are described below.

## Powers and Actions
When you wish to use a power, you must take the appropriate action to activate it. Consult the following table for how to activate each action requirement. 
<!-- If the power has an action requirement of Active, Swift, or Reaction, you can use it by taking the appropriate action. The action requirement of Attack can be used during the [Attack Action](todo.html), this is a special action requirement since it counts toward the multiple attack penalty. Similarly,  The action requirement of Complete is another special one, requiring that you declare its use during the Intention Phase and the power will not take full effect until the End Phase, any cost is spent at the end of the Intention Phase, after all accumulations have occurred. -->

## Types of Powers
Below are the types of powers that you can find in Kaiser. The description of each type includes how to use your Offensive or Defensive Skills (if required) and if the power can be seen on the material plane.

### Attack
Powers of this type allow you to perform an Offensive Roll against a target (or targets) using the appropriate Offensive Skill. This power is equivalent to a thrown projectile attack. The Base Damage is determined by the power and the Maximum Distance is based on your Offensive Skill or is listed in the powers description. 

Attack powers can be seen on the material plane.

For making offensive rolls, go to the [Attacking and Defending](rule_combat_attack_defend.html) section in the Combat Chapter.

### Defense
Defense powers allow you to use an appropriate Defensive Skill to prevent certain attacks, depending on the what the Power allows. Most Defense powers create a supernatural barrier. Powers that do not create supernatural barriers will list how to defend with them.

Defense powers are visible on the material plane.

For making defensive rolls, go to the [Attacking and Defending](rule_combat_attack_defend.html) section in the Combat Chapter.

### Effect
Powers of this type target an aspect of a creature. You use an appropriate Offensive Skill to aim and strike the target. The target applies their Absorption and AV — usually Force. If you obtain at least one Unit of Damage, then you cause the target to make a Resistance Check listed by the power. Gaining additional Units of Damage have no effect on the Resistance Check.

Effect powers never deal damage from the Offensive Roll — unless the power is also of the Attack Type. The power will list if it has the immaterial or imbued traits. 

Effect Powers are equivalent to a thrown projectile. If the power has the immaterial trait, then it cannot be seen on the material plane; the power will list what vision is required to not apply the Blind Penalty to defend. Powers that belong to both Attack and Effect are visible on the material plane regardless of the immaterial trait. 

For making offensive rolls, go to the [Attacking and Defending](rule_combat_attack_defend.html) section in the Combat Chapter. Remember that effect powers are a special type of attack that does not produce damage from the Offensive Roll.

### Automatic
Powers of this type produce automatic effects on you, another creature, or the environment. They usually produce beneficial effects. The maximum distance will be listed or is determined by an appropriate Offensive Skill and you do not require an Offensive Roll unless the target is in a difficult position. If no Resistance Check Difficulty is listed, the target can resist with a SR 8 Check. 

Automatic powers usually have the immaterial trait. As with Effect powers, if they have the immaterial trait then the power is not visible on the material plane. But the after-effect can be material, like shedding light or healing wounds.

### Trigger
Powers of this type have certain triggering conditions and do not require Offensive Skills for range or aim. Any target who meets the conditions automatically suffer the effects of the power. 

Trigger powers are frequently Effect as well, in this case the target makes the Resistance Check when the triggering condition is meet. A target who passes the Resistance Check is immune to the Power's Resistance Check for a number of rounds equal to their Degree of Success. Once the immunity ends and the conditions are meet again, the target must make another Resistance Check.

Some trigger powers can have a center point other than you. The center can be placed anywhere within range of your Offensive Skill. You may require an Offensive Roll if the target is in a difficult position.

Trigger powers usually have the immaterial trait. As with Effect powers, if they have the immaterial trait then the power is not visible on the material plane. But the after-effect can be material, like shedding light or healing wounds.

### Detection
Powers of this type are a special type of trigger power. The trigger is being within range and it allows you to gain information, whether that be location, condition, or features, of any target that fails the Resistance Check. Detection powers can be negated by some powers and a target gets a bonus to the Resistance Check based on their Conceal Ki Skill if they have developed it.

### Passive
Powers of this type have their effects always active. The power might still allow you to suppress the power and reactivate it later, in which case it is a Swift Action to turn off and back on.

## Maintaining Powers
Some powers allow you to keep their effects activate for a long time. Each power that can be maintained has a cost that must be payed during the End Phase every increment of time. If you are unable to pay the cost, the power ends when the round does.

### Turn
Powers with a maintenance of Turn require you to pay their maintenance cost each round. 

### Minor Sustain
Powers with a maintenance of Minor Sustain, sometimes just called Minor, require you to pay their maintenance cost every minute (10 rounds).

### Major Sustain
Powers with a maintenance of Major Sustain, sometimes just called Major, require you to pay their maintenance cost every ten minutes (100 rounds).

### Daily
Powers with a maintenance of Daily require you to pay their maintenance cost every day at dawn, unlike the other maintenance values.

## Common Power Features
Many powers share similar features. Below are some general rules that are described below to either clarify or provide some further detail.

### Immaterial
Ghosts, spirits, and other creatures that do not fully exist on the material plane have a trait called immaterial. This trait gives them the ability to ignore material objects like weapons, armor, and shields; this can make them difficult or impossible to fight.

In order to hit a creature with the immaterial trait, your attack must have the imbued trait and a presence equal to or greater than that of the creature. All attacks that deal damage from the Energy Group naturally have the imbued trait. For Physical and Elemental damage, you need to gain the imbued trait from some other feature, ability, or power. Whether a power, dealing damage from the Resistance Group, is imbued will be listed in the power's description.

Similarly, a creature with the immaterial trait will make its attacks immaterial as well. To defend against such an attack, you must either dodge or block it with an imbued object.

The talent of Presence Extrusion allows you to grant the imbued trait to your weapons and give them a presence equal to twice yours. The meta magic ability Imbued Spell allows your attack and defense spells to gain the imbued trait. A phenom will list at what degree it gains the imbued trait. Some artifacts can also give you or your powers the imbued trait as well.

### Area Attack
Some powers have the ability to affect a large area with a single attack. This area attack can take many different shapes: sphere, cylinder, cone, line, and so on. Each valid target within the volume of the attack must make a Defensive Roll against your Offensive Roll (only one roll). The area attack will still count as a thrown projectile for the purpose of defense.

A target can dodge out of the area of the attack if they have enough movement remaining to reach a point outside the volume of the attack. If they have not taken the Movement Action this turn, they can spend 1 AP to take the Movement Action as a Reaction, but they can only use half of it to move out of the way. The target makes a Defensive Roll against the attack. If they are unable to reach a safe point for whatever reason, they apply a -8 penalty to the Defensive Roll.

The ability to block an area attack depends on the traits that the area attack and the target's defense possess. How each trait affects the defense of a target is described with the trait. In general, having an imbued defense will allow the target to defend normally.

### Affected Presence
All objects and creatures have a certain amount of essence in the world, measured by their presence. Some powers are only able to affect a certain sum of presence. In these cases, the sum of the affected presence must be equal to or less than the listed presence. 

In general, the presence of equipment, cloths, and even most artifacts do not need to be included when determining affected presence as long as it is on the target's person.

For example, if you were to cast the spell Invisibility at the Base Degree you can affect a maximum of 10 presence. So, you can target three creatures with 3 presence each, two creatures with 5 presence each, or one creature with 6 presence and another with 4 presence. Anything the creature is carrying, that is also not sentient) does not count toward the presence total. So, a target holding a magic sword with the presence of 12 would still turn the sword invisible until they drop it. But since the sword has a presence higher than the spells affected amount the sword cannot be targeted.

### Target Selection
You are not able to specify targets for an area attack unless otherwise listed. If you are unaware of a creature's existence within the area, you cannot deselect them even if the power allows.

### Allowing the Effect
If the target desires to be affected by a power they are aware of, then they can choose to fail the Resistance Check. If the target has multiple personalities controlling it, then only if all the personalities agree can the target choose to fail. If for instance you are possessed by a spirit, the spirit and you may not both agree to being healed or being subject to a paralyzing power.

### Ghostly Damage
Some powers that produce illusions can cause the target to believe they took damage. As long as the target believes the illusion, they will believe the damage to be real as well. If the target were to be reduced to zero LP from Ghostly Damage, they are instead left unconscious. But if Ghostly Damage were to produce a Critical that would kill them, they may still die of shock.

### Repeat Resistance Checks
When a power subjects a target to a Resistance Check that causes a lingering effect, the target gets a new Resistance Check after a number of rounds have passed equal to their Degree of Failure. If the power ends, either due to you no longer maintaining it or due to an external force, the effect also ends without the target having to make another Resistance Check.

### Marking
Some powers cause you to mark the target. The power will list how long a creature will remain marked. Marks usually occur as a result of an attack or effect power. What a mark does after being applied is listed with the power that caused it or in another related power.

## Stacking of Powers
Many powers grant bonuses or penalties to any number of different abilities. How each ability handles multiple sources of increase and decrease is described below. In general, only take the best bonus and the worst penalty.

### Skill Bonus and Penalty
A skill bonus gained from multiple powers will apply the highest bonus, then half of the second highest, a third of the third highest, and so on. A skill penalty gained from multiple powers will apply the highest penalty, then half of the second highest, a third of the third highest, and so on. Always round down for bonuses and penalties.

Any bonus or penalty that comes from a Maneuver, Situation, or State are added together, unless explicitly stated otherwise like with Blind and Surprised.

### Characteristic Bonus and Penalty
A characteristic bonus or penalty will increase or decrease one of your Characteristics, such as Strength or Perception. Any bonus gained from multiple powers will apply the greatest bonus. Any penalty gained from multiple powers will apply the worst penalty. 

Some powers allow you to sacrifice a point in a characteristic to gain some special benefit. When this is done, it reduces your base Characteristic, so it does not count as a penalty.

## Power Collision
It is possible for two powers or supernaturally charged objects to collide with one another. The results of the collision will depend on the strength of the colliding projectiles. To create a collision, you must meet three criteria: you have to take the Collide Power Reaction, be in a position and have the ability to make a parallel shot, and have an Initiative within 5 points of the opponent that launched the original projectile, or surpass their Initiative. Then you use a ranged attack power (or shoot a supernaturally charged projectile as a Reaction) at the opposing power. You make an Offensive Roll and the result must be within 5 points of the opposing roll, or surpass it. If you achieve this result, then both you and the opponent roll 2d6 and add the Base Damage of the Power. The Degree of Difference (DoD) is compared to the below table.

{% include table-index.html index="MAGIC60" %}

It is possible to have two or more powers combine during a collision. The value added to the Collision roll is the highest Base Damage of the combined Powers, and then half the second greatest, and a third of the third greatest, and so on.
