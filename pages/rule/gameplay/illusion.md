Illusions are a false sensory stimuli produced by a power. The illusion can alter a targets sense of sight, touch, smell, hearing, taste, spacial awareness, passage of time, balance, pain, temperature, and body awareness just to name a few. More complex illusions can alter multiple senses at one time, giving a fuller, more convincing, reality.

Powers that produce illusions have two qualities that affect how they are interacted with. The type of illusions determines how it alters the perception of others. Control governs how you can shape the information after the power is activated. The combination of these two qualities will help you and the Game Master determine how the illusion interacts with other creatures.

## Type
The type of an illusion determines how it alters the perceptions of creatures and part of the rules to discover it.

### Figments
Figments allow you to create new sensory information that you project into the world. Once you are conscious of the false information, it becomes semi-transparent allowing you to see it and what is behind it without issue. A Notice or Search Check with a Degree of Difficulty set by the power can be used to determine the nature of the information. A creature can also informed of the falsehood if the illusion is intercepted with an object and does not react as expected. If the creature is informed of the illusion by another, the illusion is not broken, but the Search Degree of Difficulty is halved. The Notice Check can only be performed when first seeing the Figment and each time the creature is given a reason to doubt.

A Figment is not capable of dealing illusory damage since its nature is revealed when the attack land. But, that does not mean that you cannot use them to attack while a creature believes in them.

### Glamors
Glamors allow you to change some already existing sensory information. The creature can attempt a Notice or Search Check with a Degree of Difficulty set by the power to detect the illusion, but unlike Figments, Glamors do not disappear or become transparent after being detected. Instead, knowing of the illusion allows you to no longer be deceived by it, removing any States placed upon you by the illusion.

A Glamor is not capable of dealing illusory damage since its nature is revealed when the attack land. But, that does not mean that you cannot use them to attack while a creature believes in them.

### Phantasms
Phantasms are the most power type of illusion and cannot be ignored simply as it exists in the mind of an affected creature. Since this type exists only in the mind, it can only be overcome with a Resistance Check. A new check is allowed when the power allows. Being informed of the illusionary nature does not cause the the power to end, only granting two degrees of Advantage on the Resistance Check.

Only Phantasms can be used to deal illusory damage since they exist in the mind, which can make a creature think they are hurt. Damage inflicted this way uses the Damage Type that the creature believes they are being hit with, applying all armor, resistances, and vulnerabilities. But once the illusion is broken, the damage done is reduced to a tenth of what they took.

## Control
The control of an illusion lets you change the shape of the illusion after it has been created. This control can make the illusion more believable as it can react as expected.

### Static
Static means that once the illusion is created, you have no ability to change it or move it. The illusion itself is simple, being unable to move. You can create humanoid shapes but they are unable to move, making the Notice and Search Check to detect their illusion halved. Static illusions are usually of the Figment type, but some Glamors are static as well such as Invisibility.

### Programmed
Programmed allows you to set up some general instructions that the illusion will follow. Examples of these instructions are distract the guards, walk around the garden, or sleep. The illusion is unable to make decisions, so it cannot be programmed to be a lookout. Any Skill Check that the illusion would make uses your Final Skill Value. Programmed illusions can be any type, but usually are a Figment.

### Active
Active allows you to use your actions to change the shape of the illusion, such as causing it to walk or dodge attacks. Any Skill Check that the illusion would make uses your Final Skill Value. You share Action Points and any limited actions with the illusion as well, such as declaring the Run Action, taking Attack Actions and penalties to multiple Blocks and Dodges. Active illusions can be any type, but are usually Phantasms.

### Sentient
Sentient gives you complete control over the actions of the illusion since it possesses a copy of your consciousness. Any Skill Check that the illusion would make uses your Final Skill Value. But, unlike Active, the illusion and you do not share Action Points or limited actions. Sentient illusions can be any type, but are usually Phantasms.

## Damage from Illusions
An important point of illusions is that they do not do real damage. But, a creatures mind can be tricked into
