When you created a character, you calculated your total Life Points according to your Constitution and Class. These points track your physical condition and represent your resistance to deadly wounds. When these points are at their maximum, you are in perfect condition. But as you encounter damage, your LP begins to decrease and your chance of a deadly wound increase.

## Life
There are a number of ways you can lose LP. Being wounded in combat, being crushed by a collapsing building, or ingesting poisoned food are a few examples. When you suffer damage, you subtract it from your remaining LP. When your LP reaches 0 you immediately fall unconscious and are unable to observe or interact with the world.

## Between Life and Death
Once your LP falls below zero, you enter a state known as Between Life and Death. In this state, you lose 10 LP every hour (or 1 LP every 6 minutes) and can make a Presence Check of 12 to attempt to stabilize yourself at the end of the hour. If you ever fail with 6 DoF or your LP falls too low, you die.

Once you succeed, you no longer lose 10 LP every hour but are still unconscious. While in this stable state, you naturally recover 1 LP every hour until you have 1 LP. If you take any damage while in this state, you are no longer Stable and go back to Between Life and Death. While you are unconscious, you still require food and water and can be harmed by exposure to the element, if these needs are not meet you start to suffer damage as per their rules. You can also be stabilized with a Medicine Skill Check of 8.

Once your LP is above 0, you regain consciousness â€“ although you have a -6 All Action Penalty. The penalty is reduced by what is stated in your Regeneration Value.

## Death
The most common way to die is by suffer enough damage that your body loses the will to continue. This occurs when your LP is at a negative value greater than half of your total LP. The other common way to die is when you suffer a sufficiently high-level Critical Wound that causes your head to be amputated or your heart to fail. There are some other ways to die, like a spell effect causing immediate death or a phenom causing brain damage. But those methods have their own rules.

### Called Away
Either way, at the point of death your spirit leaves your body. Your spirit will remain for a number of hours equal to your Willpower multiplied by your Presence. When that time expires, your soul disappears into the Beyond and can only return by Reincarnation. While waiting for the Beyond, your spirit will either remain with the body or in the place where you died, decided by the Game Master. Beings with unfinished business or a significant connection to a material object maybe able to stay at the discretion of the GM.

## Recovery
If a wound did not kill you, you can recover from it. The rate of healing depends on the severity of the wound and your natural healing factor. Your healing factor is known as Regeneration and is based on your Constitution.

### Regeneration
Your base Regeneration Value is equal to half your Constitution Characteristic. It is not necessary to reach Inhumanity to receive Regeneration of a Constitution greater than 10, but Regenerations of 19 or 20 are special and require sufficient Gnosis.

Below is a table for how much LP is recovered each day with the specified Regeneration Value. You can double your LP recovered by resting and receiving trained medical care and move as little as possible. The table also shows the reduction in All Action penalties per day caused by Critical Hits or recovery from Between Life and Death. Lastly, sufficiently high levels of Regenerations have special recovery effects like reattaching limbs. You also gain the Special Capabilities of any lower Regeneration Value.

In the case of creatures with Damage Resistance, the amount of LP healed is multiplied by their DMR.

### Curse Damage
Some sources of supernatural damage cause lasting wounds that are difficult to heal. Life Points lost in by these types of wounds are not recovered in the conventual way; they ignore Regeneration as well spells, phenom, and other healing techniques. These cursed LP recover at a rate of equal to the average of your Constitution, Focus, and Willpower Characteristics per day. These conditions occur because curse damage is dealt to the mind, body, and soul. 

In the case of creatures with Damage Resistance, the amount of cursed damage healed is multiplied by their Damage Resistance Multiplier. Additionally, any willing curse damage (consumed by a technique, spell, phenom, or any other ability) are also multiplied by their DRM.
