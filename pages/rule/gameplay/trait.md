A trait is something inherent to an object and describes what makes it special. Some traits have an effect on the combat potential of the creature or object that possess it.

### Immaterial
The immaterial trait means that the object is able to pass through material objects. By default, the object is visible on the material plane and can interact with the material plane when it desires. If this is not the case, the object's description will list how it interacts. A weapon or attack power with the immaterial trait cannot be blocked except by an object with the imbued or immaterial trait. The weapon or defense power can also block material and immaterial attacks. 

### Imbued
The imbued trait means that the object contains supernatural energies, making it able to interact with the immaterial world. A weapon with the imbued trait can attack immaterial creatures and block immaterial attacks without issue. An attack power with the imbued trait can hit immaterial creatures. A defense power with the imbued trait can block immaterial attacks without issue. An imbued material can be used to prevent the passage of a power, such as teleportation or detection.

If the trait has a number in parentheses after it, then it can interact with immaterial objects whose presence is less than or equal to it. If no number appears, then it uses the objects presence. With the Presence Extrusion talent, any object you wield or wear is considered to have the imbued trait with a value equal to twice your presence.

### Flowing
The flowing trait means that the attack is capable of shifting its shape when it impacts an object. When a creature attempts to block a flowing attack, they suffer a -12 penalty since your attack can flow around the attempt to block. A defense with the imbued trait allows the target to extend their defense in such a way as to properly block a flowing attack. The GM may consider where the diverted flow goes, possibly reconnecting behind the target. 

An area attack with the flowing trait, along with being difficult to block, will maintain its volume if the power is created in a confined space. 

{% include meta.html content="For the sake of time, it is recommended to only consider the area, and not the volume, on a battle grid that a flowing power would take. Another fast way to handle this is to consider the center point shifted until the area would not touch any other surface." %}

### Linear
The linear trait means that the attack travels in straight lines from its origin point, up to it's maximum. Once the line hits an object, it is unable to travel farther. If the attack also has the immaterial trait, it will keep traveling until it hits an imbued object.

### Two-handed
The two-handed trait means that the weapon is designed to be used with two hands. While wielding it in two-hands, you add your Strength Modifier twice to the Base Damage. If you do not use it in two hands, you apply a -8 penalty to Initiative, Strike, and Block Checks.

### Versatile
The versatile trait means that the weapon is designed to be used in one or two hands. While wielding it in two-hands, you add your Strength Modifier twice to the Base Damage. The Strength Requirement to wield one-handed is listed after the two-handed requirement. 

### Complex
The complex trait means that the object, be it a weapon, power, or an object, is difficult to use. The chance of a Fumble is increased by one level when using the object. This usually only applies for Offensive and Block Checks.

### Throwable
The throwable trait means that the object is designed to be thrown as well as used in hand-to-hand combat. If you have proficiency with the object, you can throw it without taking the improvised projectile penalties.

### Precision
The precision trait means that the object is designed to be used to perform the directed attack, disable, knock out, and put at weapons point maneuver at half the normal penalty. You perform one of these maneuvers with this object and have the precision module, you instead quarter the penalty, round up.

### Take Down
The take down trait means that the object is designed to be used to perform the take down maneuver. If the trait has a number in parenthesis after it, then that value is used in your Opposed Characteristic Check.

If this trait is on a weapon, you still must take the take down maneuver, and spend the AP. If the weapon has a positive or negative quality, you add the quality bonus to the Opposed Characteristic Check.

If this trait is on a power, you instead make the take down maneuver as part of the power activating and do not need to spend the AP, only using the rules presented in the maneuver.

### Disarm
The disarm trait means that the object is designed to be used to perform the disarm maneuver. If the trait has a number in parenthesis after it, then that value is used in your Opposed Characteristic Check.

If this trait is on a weapon, you still must take the disarm maneuver, and spend the AP. Additionally, you can perform the disarm maneuver on a Counter when you block with this weapon. If the weapon has a positive or negative quality, you add the quality bonus to the Opposed Characteristic Check.

If this trait is on a power, you instead make the disarm maneuver as part of the power activating and do not need to spend the AP, only using the rules presented in the maneuver.

### Trapping
The trapping trait means that the object is designed to be used to perform the trapping maneuver. If the trait has a number in parenthesis after it, then that value is used in your Opposed Characteristic Check.

If this trait is on a weapon, you still must take the trapping maneuver, and spend the AP. If the weapon has a positive or negative quality, you add the quality bonus to the Opposed Characteristic Check.

If this trait is on a power, you instead make the trapping maneuver as part of the power activating and do not need to spend the AP, only using the rules presented in the maneuver.

### Reach

The reach trait means that the weapon is designed to be used to perform the sweeping attack maneuver with a greater area. It can hit two more creatures than normal. If the trait has a number in parenthesis after it, then that value is how many feet away the object can hit a creature with the sweeping attack.

### Sweeping
The sweeping trait means that the object is designed to be used to perform the sweeping attack maneuver. The trait will have a number in parentheses after it, that value is how many targets you can be hit in a single sweeping attack.

If this trait is on a weapon, you still must take the sweeping attack maneuver, and spend the AP. But, the weapon's size does not determine the number of targets.

If this trait is on a power, you instead make the sweeping attack maneuver as part of the power activating and do not need to spend the AP, only using the rules presented in the maneuver. If the power does not also have the reach trait, then you can only hit creatures you would normally reach as per the sweeping attack maneuver.

### Charging
The charging trait means that the object is designed to be effective when used to attack a while charging on a mounted creatuire. You add four times the mount's Strength Modifier to the Base Damage of an attack made as part of a charge.

### Double
The double trait means that the weapon is capable of attacking with both ends. When you take the _Attack Intention_, you can declare that you will use both ends of the weapon to attack. This allows you to use the other end as part of the _Offhand Attack_ action. If you choose to not declare both ends, the weapon and it's attacks are otherwise unchanged.
