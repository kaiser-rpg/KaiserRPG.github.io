States are split into four groups: Man vs. Man, Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Self, and Man vs. Society. The name of each group corresponds to what the opposing force is. For example, Man vs. Man states involve you having a state over another creature while Man vs. Nature are externally caused but by no single creature.

Each state describes when it occurs and the penalties or negatives that arise from having it. The exception to this is Man vs. Man states, each of those states requires you to have that state over another creature.
