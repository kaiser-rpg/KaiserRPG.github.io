## Falling
You are considered to have the [@state Falling @] state when you cannot stop your rapid decent towards a surface. The greater the distance, the greater the damage you take upon impact with a surface. Falling uses the Severity Level from the [@action Impact @] maneuver. When you land after falling, compare the distance you fell and what you collide with to the Severity table. Take the Severity level in between the distance and collision to determine Final Damage; the Game Master can chose a value in the listed range. The Final Damage can be halved, round down, if you make an [@skill Athletics @] or [@skill Acrobatics @] Check with a Very Difficult (20) Degree of Difficulty; you can add your Impact AV to this check. For every 4 Degrees of Success, the damage is halved again, round down.

{% include meta.html content="The above table figures for standard earth gravity and terminal velocity occurring after 1,500 feet. A standard human on a standard planet will fall 500 feet the first round and then each round that follows, ze will fall 1000 feet. Once ze reach terminal velocity, ze will not have any more potential energy from falling so the Severity Level from falling cannot be greater than Level 4."%}

## Lack of Air
You are considered to have the [@state Lack of Air @] state when you cannot take in fresh air. If you were unprepared for the lack of air you can continue without issue for a number of rounds equal to your [@stat Constitution @] Characteristic. If you were prepared, you instead can last a number of minutes equal to your [@stat Constitution @] Characteristic. Each End Phase after you run out of air, you must make a [@stat Constitution @] Check of 5. Failure means your body needs fresh air and you are at risk of falling unconscious. Each time you pass the check, the difficulty increases by one. Additionally, some situations might cause you to lose your breath.

Once you run out of air, you need to make a Physical Resistance Check each round to stay conscious. The difficulty starts at 8 and increases by 1 point with every success. Every round you are without air, you also gain one degree of [@state Pain @]. If the [@state Pain @] state from [@state Lack of Air @] ever increases to twice your [@stat Constitution @] Characteristic, you die due to asphyxiation. 

## Sleep
You are considered to have the [@state Sleep @] state while you are asleep. You suffer a `-10` deed penalty on all [@stat Perception @] based Skill and Characteristic Checks, do not roll [@skill Initiative @], and cannot take any actions. You can be shaken awake quickly as an Active Action costing 2 AP, you can then roll [@skill Initiative @] next round. Something injuring you or making a loud sound will cause you to wake up and roll Initiative with a a `-4` deed penalty next round.

## Partially Blind
You are considered to have the [@state Partially Blind @] state when you cannot see your opponent clearly but can still see large movements. For example, a flash or light or a shadowy area.

This state is not to be confused with the [@state Flanked @] or [@state From Behind @] states. While they can both occur, being flanked is due to positioning but you can still turn to see your opponent as part of the Defensive Roll.

## Totally Blind
You are considered to have the [@state Totally Blind @] state when you cannot see your opponent at all due to an issue with vision. For example, an area of complete darkness.

## Proned
You are considered to have the [@state Proned @] state when you are lying on the ground or sitting. An opponent who is close to you can also gain the [@state Higher Ground @] state over you.

## Narrow Space
You are considered to have the [@state Narrow Space @] state when you are in a space that limits your movements. You also gain this state when you are trying to limit your swings to avoid damage to nearby objects, such as bystanders.

A normal human will gain this state when in a space that is less than 3 feet wide.

## Partially Restrained
You are considered to have the [@state Partially Restrained @] state when your movement is slightly restricted. For example, your arm is chained to the wall.

Your Movement and other values might be modified further by the restraint.

## Mostly Restrained
You are considered to have the [@state Mostly Restrained @] state when your movement is limited. For example, your arms and legs are in chains.

Your Movement and other values might be modified further by the restraint.

## Fully Restrained
You are considered to have the [@state Fully Restrained @] state when you are fully and completely immobilized. For example, you are paralyzed.

In addition to the penalties, you cannot take any action and your Movement Value becomes zero while in this state. Your other values might be modified further by the restraint.
