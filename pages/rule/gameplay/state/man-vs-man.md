## At Weapon's Point
You gain the [@state At Weapon's Point @] state over an opponent when you have put a weapon in a threatening position. After you have successfully performed the [@action Put At Weapon's Point @] maneuver, you gain the [@state At Weapon's Point @] state over your target. You can use this to attack your opponent as a Swift Action. Once used this way, the state ends.

## Suspended
You are considered to have the [@state Suspended @] state over an opponent when they are held in the air without complete control over their movement while you have control over your movement. Two creatures who are held in the air are equal.

## Flight
You are considered to have the [@state Flight @] state over an opponent when you have a Flight Speed that is 7 points higher theirs and have ample room to maneuver. 

## Surprised
You are considered to have the [@state Surprised @] state over an opponent when you have caught them off-guard. This can also occur when your [@skill Initiative @] Roll is 20 points greater than your opponents, and they have not yet taken their turn this round.

## Charmed
You are considered to have the [@stat Charmed @] state over an opponent when you used a power that makes them friendly and suggestible. They will not attack you and will try to follow through with what you ask. But demands that go against their nature or abusive actions break the state.

The duration of this state will depend on its source. If caused by a power, the power will list how long it lasts, generally one round per Degree of Failure.
