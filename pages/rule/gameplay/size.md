Size indicates your expected height and weight. To calculate it, add your [@stat Strength @] and [@stat Constitution @] Characteristics. 

{% include example.html content="A character with an 8 and 7 in those Characteristics would have a size score of 15." %}

For a recommended height and weight of the character, consult the following table and choose a number between those given for the appropriate size.

{% include table-index.html table="gameplay" index="400" %}

Your size is also used to determine how much food you must eat each day. A complete day of food requires you to consume an amount of nutrition equal to your size. Failure to do so can cause you to start losing stamina.
