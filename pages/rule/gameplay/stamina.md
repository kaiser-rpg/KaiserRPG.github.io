Your Stamina is an abstract measure of many times you can exert yourself before becoming exhausted. Your maximum number of Stamina Points is equal to your Constitution plus your Willpower Characteristics. 

When your Stamina gets low, you will start to suffer the effects of exhaustion. This will start to give you an All Action Penalty the fewer points you have remaining.

If the maximum Stamina points you have is less than or equal to an amount that gives an All Action penalty, you only suffer the penalties after spending any number of Stamina points.

> Samwell has a maximum of 4 Stamina points. When he has all his Stamina Points, he does not suffer the -1 penalty to all his actions. But as soon as he loses one point, he gains the -2 All Action penalty since he only has 3 points remaining.

When you have no Stamina remaining, each round you must a Composure Check equal to the number of rounds you have had zero Stamina. Failure means you fall unconscious. If an affect causes you to lose another point of Stamina while you have none, you are knocked unconscious. 

Once unconscious from exhaustion, you will not regain consciousness until you have regained at least five Stamina Points (or your maximum). During this time, you might lose LP.

## Needs

### Sleep
You recover one Stamina Point after 6 hours of sleep in a nice bed or after 12 hours of sleep in a poor bed. Failing to rest for 6 hours in a 48-hour period, you instead lose one Stamina Point.

If you do not need to sleep, you do not gain Stamina from sleep but you do not lose any by not resting. Consider recovering Stamina by meditation.

### Eating
You recover two Stamina points each day that you consume an amount of nutrition equal to your size. Consuming twice as much nutrition will recover three Stamina, three times as much nutrition will restore four points, and so on. Failing to eat at least half your size in nutrition in a 48 period will cause you to lose one Stamina point.

Your need for water is considered to be included with your need for food. If you are able to fulfill your water need in a 24 hour period, the Game Master can cause you to take Bio Damage equal to your Degree of Failure times 10 from a Physical Resistance Check of the Difficult (12) Degree. Every 24 hours without water increases the Resistance Check by one Degree of Difficulty. In places with low moisture, the Game Master might increase how much water you need per period of time.

If you do not need to eat, you do not gain Stamina from food but you do not lose any by not eating. Consider recovering Stamina by meditation.

### Meditation
You recover three Stamina after meditating for 6 hours. This meditation does not count for recovering ki, mana or phenom points.

### Second Wind
In intense situations, where you have been nearly defeated, you can spend Stamina to gain a second wind. In order to use this, your Life Points must be less than half your maximum. As a swift action, you can spend 15 Stamina points to regain half of your maximum LP. 

Once this is used, it cannot be used again until at least two weeks of downtime have passed.

In order to use this, your Life Points must be less than half your maximum or you must be in a deadly situation that could be prevented by gaining the points from this feature. As a swift action, you can spend 20 Stamina points to regain half of your total ki, mana, or PP.

As a swift action, you can spend 10 Stamina points to gain access to a power for 1 minute. Each additional Stamina point spent gives you access to the power for an additional minute. The power you gain access to must be one that you will eventually purchase or have already spent some downtime learning. Powers that can be revealed this way are left up to the Game Master, but for example you could gain access to a high level spell in a path, use a spirit technique within a tree you have started, or manifest a phenom within a discipline mastered.

## Passive Stamina Use
Stamina is lost when you exert yourself over a long period of time.
The periods of time reset after you take some time to rest. The Game Master will ultimately decide these time periods.

Moving a great distance can be exhausting. Below is how quickly you lose Stamina points while moving at different paces. If you are riding a creature, you lose Stamina at a fourth of that rate due to discomfort. If you are traveling in a comfortable position, you do not lose any Stamina from travel.

**Walking**: This is usually about 3 miles per hour. You lose 1 Stamina point every 6 hours.

**Marching**: This is a fast but steady paced walking speed at about 5 miles per hour. You lose 1 Stamina point every 2 hours (3 points per 6 hours).

**Running**: You are considered to be running when you are moving a number of feet each round above your dash distance and less than your run distance. You lose 1 Stamina Point for every ten minutes of running. You can increase the time by five minutes for every 4 points of Final Athletics Skill.
