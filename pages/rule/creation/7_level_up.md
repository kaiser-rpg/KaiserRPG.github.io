In order to advance in levels, you need to reach a milestone that marks your advancement. When you have earned the necessary experience, you gain a new level and 10 more XP, which you can use to obtain new abilities and skill or improve those you already possess.

In order to raise a level, you must take steps similar to those used to create a character. First, you should spend the new XP following the same restrictions as character creation. You can decide to not spend all of your XP gained, saving some for later. But you will not be able to spend these points until you have sufficient downtime.

After spending XP, make sure to increase your Innate Bonuses where appropriate. If the new level is odd, your Presence, and your other Resistances, also increases by 1 point.

### Increase Characteristics
At each even level, you can add 1 point to one of your Characteristics. This increase represents your natural progression, your inherent capacity to improve. 

When one of your Characteristics increase, it is possible that it modifies some other aspect. If the new Characteristic has a different Modifier from the previous one, you should change it and recalculate your Final Skill Values. If an ability relies on the Base Characteristic value, like Life Points, be sure to also increase the related value.

### Level Up Checklists
Below is a final check list of things you need to do to level your character up:
1.	Spend the new 10 XP
2.	If it is an even level, add +1 to one Characteristic
3.	If it is an odd level, add +1 to Presence
4.	Increase Innate Bonuses from your Race, Class, and Traits
5.	Recalculate any values that changed
