In order to advance in levels, you need to reach a milestone that marks your advancement. When you have earned the necessary experience, you gain a new level and 10 more XP, which you can use to obtain new abilities and skill.

Also be sure to increase your Innate Bonuses where appropriate. If the new level is odd, your Presence, and your other Resistances, also increases by 1 point.

In order to spend your new experience points, you must spend some Downtime practicing, researching, or meditating to master your new abilities. Any XP you spend must also follow the se rules as found in Character Creation.

### Increase Characteristics
At each even level, you can add 1 point to one of your Characteristics. This increase represents your natural progression, your inherent capacity to improve. 

When one of your Characteristics increase, it is possible that it modifies some other aspect. If the new Characteristic has a different Modifier from the previous one, you should change it and recalculate your Final Skill Values. If an ability relies on the Base Characteristic value, like Life Points, be sure to also increase the related value.

### Level Up Checklists
Below is a final check list of things you need to do to level your character up:
1.	Spend the new 10 XP
2.	If it is an even level, add +1 to one Characteristic
3.	If it is an odd level, add +1 to Presence
4.	Increase Innate Bonuses from your Race, Class, and Traits
5.	Recalculate any values that changed
