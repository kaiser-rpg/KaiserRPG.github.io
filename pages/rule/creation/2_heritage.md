The next stage in character creation is choosing your heritage. Heritage determines who you were in a past life or parents where, how that influenced you. The [Heritage Section](char_heritage_intro.html) lists the heritage options you can choose from and the rules associated with their selection. Each heritage will have unique benefits and may cost some of your starting XP. Depending on your setting, the Game Master may limit the available heritage options or provide new ones from the Optional Rules section.
