The next step in bringing life to your character is to select your features by spending feature points (FP). Features represent what makes you unique from your peers in the same class. Your features are something tied to your very existence and as such they are not learned or forgotten in quite the same way as experience points. You start with 6 FP which you use to buy positive features and can gain more by taking negative features. You cannot have more than 3 negative features and do not need to take any. A list of positive and negative features can be found [here](char_feature_common.html).

Features are broken up into the common, magic, and manifest groups. Common features can be taken by anyone. Magic features require you to have The Gift feature and any FP gained from a negative magic feature can only be used to buy positive magic features. Similarly, the manifest group can only be taken if take one of the common features that give you phenom; any FP from negative manifest features can only be used to buy positive manifest features.

{% include meta.html content="It is worth keeping in mind for both the players and the Game MAster that there are no free negative features. The penalties of being Blind should not be overcome by simple means. A spell to regenerate the eyes should still fail or give a different negative feature of equal value. If the Game Master allows, you can use the Optional Rule to payoff negative features to remove them when a plausible reason occurs." %}
