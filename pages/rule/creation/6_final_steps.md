All that remains are a few final steps.

### Derived Characteristics
Once you have your Characteristics and Skills, you can calculate the derived characteristics.

#### Movement Value
Movement Value represents the maximum speed at which you can run. It is equivalent to the Agility Characteristic: if you have an Agility of 7, your movement value is also 7. 

To know how far you can cover, consult the table below. The distance listed there is the maximum distance you can run in one Movement Action, and thus one round. Your Movement Value can be modified by having a high Athletics Skill.

{% include table-index.html index = "GEN3" %}

#### Size
Size indicates your expected height and weight. To calculate it, add your Strength and Constitution Characteristics. 

> For example, a character with an 8 and 7 in those Characteristics would have a size score of 15. 

For a recommended height and weight of the character, consult the following table and choose a number between those given for the appropriate size.

{% include table-index.html index = "GEN4" %}

### Innate Bonuses
As the result of your Race, Traits, and Class, some of your skills and abilities will improve without having to spend XP. These Innate Bonuses are added at 1st level and again at each level increment noted.

#### Class Bonuses
Each Class has an Innate Bonus for Life Points and Initiative. These are added each time you gain a level.

#### Limitation to Attack, Block, Dodge Innate Bonuses
Some Classes and Traits grant an Innate Bonus of +1 every other level in Attack, Block, or Dodge Skills. Whereas improvement in other skills have no limits, the Innate Bonus increase for Attack, Block, and Dodge can never be greater than +5, that is to say, ten levels of Innate Bonuses. Even if you change Classes, this limit applies.

### Life Points
Life Points (LP) represent the amount of damage you can suffer before dying or receiving a Critical.

Your Final Life Point Value is based on Constitution. You start with 20 points and add your Constitution multiplied by ten. To this number you should add your Innate Bonus.

You can increase your Life Points by investing in Life Point Multiplies, the cost of which is determined by your Class. Each time you buy a multiple, you can increase your Life Points by your Constitution. Essentially, each purchase adds 1 to the original 10 that your Constitution is multiplied by.

{% include equation.html eq = "Final LP = 20 + (Constitution × (10 + LP Mult. Purchased)) + Innate LP Bonus" %}

### Initiative
The Base Initiative of a normal-sized character is always 10. To calculate the Final Initiative Value, add your Dexterity and Agility Modifiers. Finally, add your Innate Bonus or other bonuses from Traits or supernatural effects. This number will be modified each round depending on what you intend to do.

### Presence and Resistance
Presence is the sum of all of your existential aspects – both physical and spiritual. You have an almost unlimited potential to develop your abilities; the more developed, the greater the Presence. Your Presence starts at 3 and increases by +1 every odd level.

In Kaiser, there are five types of Resistance, each one protecting you against a different type of negative effect. Resistance values are calculated by adding your Presence to the applicable modifier.

The five types of resistance are:

**Presence (PrR)**: This is the sum of your existence. This is not affected by any Characteristics.

**Physical Resistance (PhR)**: Represents your bodies ability to tolerate shock or withstand force. Based on Constitution.

**Immune Resistance (IR)**: Represents your ability to avoid falling ill or being affected by a disease and poisons. Based on Constitution.

**Spirit Resistance (SR)**: Represents how well your spirit can resist an effect of supernatural origin. Based on Focus.

**Mental Resistance (MR)**: Represents your control of internal forces, allowing you to resist mental attacks. Based on Willpower.

### Primary and Secondary Groups
Your knowledge and expertise in certain tasks are known as Skills. Each Skill has a number of points that represent the sum of your natural talent and training. These Skills are broken up into Primary and Secondary Groups. Skills in the Primary Groups are further divided into the Martial, Magic, and Psychic Groups. The Secondary Groups are also divided into Groups, things like Exertion, Intellectual, and Creative. More detail can be found in Chapter 4.

#### Primary Groups
Primary Groups represent your basic faculties and are divided into three areas: Martial, Magic, and Psychic.

##### Martial Group
These abilities encompass your skills in fighting with your physical body, sometimes enhanced by your spirit. fighting skills.  Martial Skills are the following:

#### Secondary Groups
Naturally, you possess much more complexity than simply being able to fight or cast spells. These are known as Secondary Skills and each one is part of a Secondary Group and is linked to a specific Characteristic. For example, the Acrobatics Skill is in the Exertion Group and depends upon your Agility, while Sciences fall under the Intellectual Group and depend upon Intelligence. You will find a complete description of Secondary Skills in Chapter 4.

#### Calculating and Using Skills
To calculate your final Primary or Secondary Skill, add the Base Value (what you get by spending Development Points) to the Modifier of the Characteristic tied to that Skill. Lastly, add any other special modifiers like Innate Bonuses from your Race and Class. The result will be the Final Skill Value, the number added to a Skill Check roll.
