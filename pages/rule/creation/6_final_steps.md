All that remains are a few final steps.

## Innate Bonuses
As the result of your Race, Features, and Class, some of your skills and abilities will improve without having to invest XP. These innate bonuses are added at 1st level and again at each level increment noted.

### Class Bonuses
Each Class has an innate bonus for Life Points and [@skill Initiative @]. These are added each time you gain a level.

### Limitation to Strike, Block, Dodge Innate Bonuses
Some Classes and Features grant an innate bonus of `+1` every other level in [@skill Strike @], [@skill Block @], or [@skill Dodge @] skills. Whereas improvement in other skills have no limits, the innate bonus increase for [@skill Strike @], [@skill Block @], and [@skill Dodge @] can never be greater than `+5`, that is to say, ten levels of innate bonuses. Even if you change Classes, this limit applies.

## Life Points
Life Points (LP) represent the amount of damage you can suffer before dying or receiving a Critical.

Your Final Life Point Value is based on [@stat Constitution @]. You start with 20 points and add your [@stat Constitution @] multiplied by ten. To this number you should add your innate bonus.

You can increase your Life Points by investing in Life Point Multiplies, the cost of which is determined by your Class. Each time you buy a multiple, you can increase your Life Points by your [@stat Constitution @]. Essentially, each purchase adds 1 to the original 10 that your [@stat Constitution @] is multiplied by.

{% include equation.html eq = "Final LP = 20 + (Constitution Ã— (10 + LP Mult. Purchased)) + Innate LP Bonus" %}

## Initiative
The Base [@skill Initiative @] Value of a normal-sized character is always 10. To calculate the Final [@skill Initiative @] Value, add your [@stat Dexterity @] and [@stat Agility @] Modifiers. Finally, add your innate bonus or other bonuses from Features or powers. This number will be modified each round depending on what you intend to do.

## Presence and Resistance
Presence is the sum of all of your existential aspects -- both physical and spiritual. You have an almost unlimited potential to develop your abilities; the more developed, the greater the Presence. Your Presence starts at 3 and increases by +1 every odd level.

In Kaiser, there are five types of Resistance, each one protecting you against a different type of negative effect. Resistance values are calculated by adding your Presence to the applicable Modifier.

The five types of resistance are:

**Presence (PrR)**: This is the sum of your existence. This is not affected by any Characteristics.

**Physical Resistance (PhR)**: Represents your bodies ability to tolerate shock or withstand force. Based on [@stat Constitution @].

**Immune Resistance (IR)**: Represents your ability to avoid falling ill or being affected by a disease and poisons. Based on [@stat Constitution @].

**Spirit Resistance (SR)**: Represents how well your spirit can resist an effect of supernatural origin. Based on [@stat Focus @].

**Mental Resistance (MR)**: Represents your control of internal forces, allowing you to resist mental attacks. Based on [@stat Willpower @].

## Primary and Secondary Groups
Your knowledge and expertise in certain tasks are known as Skills. Each Skill has a number of points that represent the sum of your natural talent and training. These Skills are broken up into Primary and Secondary Groups. Skills in the Primary Groups are further divided into the Martial, Magic, and Manifest Groups. The Secondary Groups are also divided into Groups, things like Exertion, Intellectual, and Creative. More detail can be found in Chapter 4.

### Primary Groups
Primary Groups represent your basic faculties and are divided into three areas: Martial, Magic, and Psychic.

#### Martial Group
These abilities encompass your skills in fighting with your physical body, sometimes enhanced by your spirit. Martial Skills are the following:

**Strike Skill**: This represents your ability to strike your opponent and deal damage. This skill depends on [@stat Dexterity @]. The first time you invest XP to increase your [@skill Strike @] kill, you may choose a single weapon to become proficient with.

**Block Skill**: This represents your ability to place an object between you and a threat. This skill depends on [@stat Dexterity @].

**Dodge Skill**: This represents your ability to remove yourself from a dangerous position. This skill depends upon the [@stat Agility @] Characteristic.

**Wear Armor Skill**: This represents your ability to wear and move around in armor. This ability depends on [@stat Strength @].

**Combat Modules**: This represents your knowledge and capability with various styles of fighting, excluding martial arts.

**Martial Arts**: This represents your knowledge and capability with unarmed combat styles.

**Spirit Knowledge**: This is your knowledge of how to use your spirit for greater power.

**Spirit Arts**: This represents your ability to use spiritual energy in physical ways. Ki, Chakra, and Ki Techniques are also included under Spirit Arts.

#### Magic Group
Magic skills encompass both spells and summoning.

**Mana**: This is a measure of your spirit's ability to cast many spells or summon forth great creatures.

**Mana Accumulation**: This ability represents your capacity to pull mana, held within your spirit, into your environment to cast spells or transfer it.

**Mana Recovery**: This ability represents your ability to gather your mana back into your spirit.

**Magic Projection Skill**: This represents your ability to direct spells. This skill depends upon the [@stat Perception @] Characteristic.

**Summon Skill**: This represents your capacity to bring forth supernatural creatures from other worlds. This skill depends upon your [@stat Focus @] Characteristic.

**Control Skill**: This represents your capacity to control certain supernatural beings. Control depends upon the [@stat Willpower @] Characteristic.

**Banish Skill**: This represents your ability to expel supernatural beings from this plane. It depends upon the [@stat Focus @] Characteristic.

**Mana Knowledge**: This is your total ability to understand the theory of mana and memorize spells.

**Mystical Modules**: This represents your capacity to utilize magic and spells in new or more efficient ways.

**Meta Magic**: These are modifications to your magic.

#### Manifest Group
Manifest abilities cover everything related to the area of phenomonon in reality, known as phenom, and their uses.

**Phenom Projection Skill**: This represents your capacity to target creatures or objects with your phenom. This skill depends upon your [@stat Perception @].

**Phenom Points (PP)**: These points are used to develop and utilize your phenom.

**Potential**: This is a special value that can only be increased by investing PP, as opposed to XP. It is based on your [@stat Willpower @].

**Manifest Modules**: This represents your capacity to utilize phenom in new or more efficient ways.

### Secondary Groups
Naturally, you possess much more complexity than simply being able to fight or cast spells. These are known as Secondary Skills and each one is part of a Secondary Group and is linked to a specific Characteristic. For example, the [@skill Acrobatics @] Skill is in the Exertion Group and depends upon your Agility, while [@skill Sciences @] fall under the Intellectual Group and depend upon Intelligence. A complete list of Secondary Skills can be found [here](todo.html).

### Calculating and Using Skills
To calculate your final Primary or Secondary Skill, add the Base Value (what you get by investing Experience Points) to the Modifier of the Characteristic tied to that skill. Lastly, add any other special modifiers like innate bonuses from your Heritage, Features, and Class. The result will be the Final Skill Value, the number added to a Skill Check roll.
