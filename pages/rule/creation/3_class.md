Your class determines how many Experience Points you must invest in each skill or ability to develop it and gives you some innate bonuses. You will see that each class has a listed Development Cost for every sub-system within Kaiser. This means your class does not limit you in what you can or cannot invest in, only how much you can invest. The best way to think of a class is an exchange rate for Experience Points to Base Values. The list of twenty classes can be found [here](class_freelancer.html). The remainder of this page explains what you will find in each class's entry.

## Archetype

The first thing listed within each class is to what archetypes it belongs. The seven archetypes are described below.

**Fighter**: The Fighter specializes in using weapons, armor, or their own bodies in combat. This archetype is the most combat focused and is best at developing the Martial Group. As you advance, be sure to buy Style Modules and Master Arts to boost your combat abilities as well as developing your Secondary Skills.

**Spiriter**: The Spiriter specializes in energies found within themselves. This archetype develops more spirit knowledge than the others and uses ki and chakra to great affect. As you advance, use your spirit knowledge to gain talents and eventually techniques to fight, move, and find. Since chakra and ki are under the Martial Group, you need to balance that with buying Style Modules and Master Arts.

**Caster**: The Caster specialize in casting spells by using the mana that their spirit has attracted. This archetype excels in developing Spell Projection and Mana Accumulation, which you need to cast. You absolutely need The Gift feature to fully develop this archetype.
