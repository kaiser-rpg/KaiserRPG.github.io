A Class defines how you will be spending your XP on abilities and skills. Each class has the ability to develop any thing in the system, but not always at the same cost. Think of a class as the exchange rate to learn something. 

Each class belongs to one or two archetypes which signal what you can expect that class to be able to do efficiently with your XP. There are seven Archetypes.

**Fighter**: The Fighter specializes in using weapons, armor, or their own bodies in combat. This Archetype is the most combat focused.

**Spiriter**: The Spiriter use the spiritual energies found within themselves, commonly known as Ki, to perform tasks that a normal man could not.

**Caster**: The Caster specialize in casting spells by using the mana that their spirit has attracted. Using these spells, a caster can perform all sorts of extraordinary feats.

**Summoner**: The Summoner is the one who is best able to tie her spirit with other beings and either borrow their power or submit them to the her will.

**Manifester**: The Manifester specializes in manifesting phenomenons just by the power of their will.

**Explorer**: The Explorer gains excellent bonuses to their Secondary Skills, allowing them to handle many different situations.

**Generalist**: The Generalist is one who can be the jack-of-all-trades or the at least pretty good at one.

The list of twenty classes can be found in Chapter 4: Classes.
