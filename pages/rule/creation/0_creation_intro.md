The first thing you need to do to play Kaiser is to create a character. This fictional individual will be the role you portray during the game. Your character is unique, based on the abilities and skills which you decide and is created according to your preferences. It is important that you have a clear idea of the type of character you want to play, so that you can portray them to the fullest. Remember, characters are more than numbers and statistics on a piece of paper. Your actions and choices in the game will breathe life into each character you create.

Before we start creating a character, let's start with a brief explanation of the steps.

1. **Generate Characteristics**: There are eight different Characteristics and a few ways to generate them. Your Game Master will tell you which one to use.

2. **Choose your Heritage**: Your heritage determines what you were in a past life and in this one. This will give you some bonuses or unique powers.

3. **Choose your Class**: This determines the cost of developing skills and abilities.

4. **Buy Features**: You have 6 Features Points. You can invest FP to gain positive features or take negative features to gain more FP.

5. **Invest Experience Points**: You have 60 Experience Points. You can invest XP into almost anything, but the cost is determined by your class and certain features. There are a few restrictions on how many of one thing you can buy. This is the hardest part, but provides the greatest amount of diversity between characters.

6. **Fill in the Rest**: All that is left is to fill in the character sheet. The innate bonuses from your heritage, class, and features are all added. You will use all your choices from before to find the final value for your Skills, Life Points, and other values.
