The starting point in creating your character is determining your Characteristics. Just as no two people are exactly alike, each character in the game has different Characteristics that represent the diversity of people who inhabit the world. 

### Characteristics
Kaiser has eight different Characteristics: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Agility, Perception, Intelligence, Focus and Willpower. The first four deal with your physical abilities, while the last three represent your mental and spiritual capabilities. Perception is a mixed attribute, influenced by your physical and mental abilities. Each Characteristic must have a number. This number defines your natural quality for tasks related to that Characteristic.

#### Strength (STR)
Strength defines your physical ability to hit hard and lift heavy objects.

#### Constitution (CON)
Constitution defines your bodies resistance to stresses such as disease, damage, and prolonged physical and mental exertion.

#### Dexterity (DEX)
Dexterity is your coordination and fine motor control. Together with Agility, this represents your reflexes. 

#### Agility (AGI)
Agility is your speed and balance. Together with Dexterity, this represents your reflexes. 

#### Perception (PER)
Perception covers all your senses and your instinct.

#### Intelligence (INT)
Intelligence covers logic and memory.

#### Focus (FC)
Focus is your ability to control external forces with your spirit.

#### Willpower (WP)
Willpower is a measure of your concentration and your control over internal forces.

### Modifier
Each Characteristic also has a derived value called its Modifier. The Modifier is the number that is added to find a Skill or Resistance's Final Value. To find the number, refer to the following table.

{% include table-index.html table="gameplay" index="200" %}

### Generating Characteristics

#### Method 1: Stat Array
You have the following arrays, each one can be assigned to a single Characteristic:
- 10 8 7 7 7 5 5 4
- 9 8 8 7 7 5 5 4
- 9 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
- 7 7 7 7 7 7 6 5

{% include meta.html content="The values found in this method are created by spending 60 points in the following method. The GM can create other arrays if they desire." %}

#### Method 2: Point Buy
You have 60 points to spend to gain a certain Characteristic Value. Each Characteristic must have at least a three and can be no greater than 10 by using this method. 

{% include table-index.html table="gameplay" index="600" %}

{% include meta.html content="The starting 60 points is only meant for extraordinary individuals, such are the players in this game. The GM should feel free to change that amount to 40 if they want a game based around more average individuals or can increase it to 80 for truly legendary characters." %}
