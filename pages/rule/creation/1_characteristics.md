The starting point in creating your character is determining your Characteristics. Just as no two people are exactly alike, each character in the game has different Characteristics that represent the diversity of people who inhabit the world.

### Generating Characteristics

#### Method 1: Stat Array
You have the following arrays, each one can be assigned to a single Characteristic:
- 10 8 7 7 7 5 5 4
- 9 8 8 7 7 5 5 4
- 9 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
- 7 7 7 7 7 7 6 5

{% include meta.html content="The values found in this method are created by spending 60 points in the following method. The GM can create other arrays if they desire." %}

#### Method 2: Point Buy
You have 60 points to spend to gain a certain Characteristic Value. Each Characteristic must have at least a 3 and can be no greater than 10 by using this method. 

{% include table-index.html table="gameplay" index="600" %}

{% include meta.html content="The starting 60 points is only meant for extraordinary individuals, such are the players in this game. The GM should feel free to change that amount to 40 if they want a game based around more average individuals or can increase it to 80 for truly legendary characters." %}
