### Mana Batteries
Mana batteries is any object that can accept mana and which mana can be drawn from. You can add mana to a battery as you would transfer to another creature, up to the limit of the battery. You can remove mana from the battery and place it in your Pool at a rate equal to your MA â€” the battery does not have the ability to transfer or generate mana. The maximum stored mana will be listed with the battery.

### Mana Amplifiers
A Mana Amplifier is any object that increases your Mana Accumulation. Unless noted, this increase in MA does not increase the amount of Mana you recover each day.

You can only benefit from one Mana Amplifier at a time.

### Mana Capacitors
A Mana Capacitor is an object capable of storing Mana, but unlike a Mana battery, it releases all the stored mana at once. Activating a Capacitor is a Free Action that costs 1 AP. All the Mana held within the Capacitor is immediately added to your accumulated mana. The Capacitor can be recharged as if it were a Mana Battery.

If you lose concentration, the mana returns to your pool and not the Capacitor.

You can Active from more than Mana Capacitor each round, as long as you pay the AP cost.

### Spell Booster
A Spell Booster is an object that increases the amount of mana used to cast a spell. This does not reduce Base Degree's Mana Cost. But the extra Mana added to the spell can be used to increase the degree or add meta magic as appropriate.

You can only benefit from one Spell Booster at a time.

### Spell Store
A Spell Store is an object that has a specific spell prepared within it and it supplies the mana. The object may be only able to cast the spell once before losing the ability or could be able to cast it multiple times each day. 

### Spell Conduit
A Spell Conduit is an object attuned to a spell, in rare cases multiple ones. You can choose to Accumulate for a Prepared Spell for any spell attuned to the Conduit.

### Spell Tomes
A Spell Tome is the written knowledge of a collection of spells. While reading the Tome, you can cast a spell from it by spending 1 AP and taking the Prepared Spell Intention. Due to needing to refer to the Tome while casting, you are counted as having taking an action and cannot gain the extra Mana at the end of a round. Most tomes only have the knowledge for a spell up to a certain degree.

It is possible that some of the listed effects could be combined into a single device. In this case, it is left to the best judgement of the GM on what the final device will do in the end. Below we list a few of the common suggestions for combinations.

Mana Battery + Mana Amplifier + Spell Conduit: This would create an object that can pull mana from within the battery and place it inside the conduit as if it was preparing the spell. This would be benefit from any extra MA for taking no action, but would automatically charge up the conduit each round until it was ready.

Mana Battery + Mana Recovery Amplifier: This would create an object that can store mana and would naturally regain mana each dawn.

Mana Battery + Mana Amplifier + Mana Capacitor: This would create an object that could move mana from the battery to the capacitor each round, based on the amplifier. Essentially a self-charging capacitor. Mana would need to be in the battery for it to be of any use.
