If you have the Gift, then you can cast any spell you know. Each spell has four degrees at which you can cast it: Base, Intermediate, Advanced, Arcane. Each degree will list a Mana Cost and Intelligence Requirement. Mana Cost is the amount of mana that you must always pay before the spell can take effect. This Mana Cost can be modified by meta magic or powerful artifacts, but that will be discussed later. Additionally, you can always spend more mana than the Mana Cost lists: usually that is done to overcome resistance to a certain amount of mana. The Intelligence Requirement must be meet in order to understand how a spell works.

Spells also have an Action Requirement of Involved or Swift depending on the nature of the spell. Involved spells require it to be your turn in the Initiative and for you to take the [Use an Involved Power](todo) action. Swift spells can be cast at any time during the round by taking the [Use a Swift Power](todo) action. 

As long as you meet all the requirements for the spell – those requirements being the accumulated mana, sufficient intelligence, and the proper action – you can cast it. A complete description of each spell can be found [here](ref_spell_intro.html).

## Casting

## Damage During Accumulation
When you suffer damage, you might lose concentration on the mana you have accumulated. You must make a Withstand Pain Difficulty Check equal to one fifth of the damage. Each Degree of Failure causes 10 mana to return to your Mana Pool from what you have accumulated. If you have more than 10 DoF, the mana is lost instead of returned to your Pool. 

If you took the Accumulate for a Prepared Spell Intention, then you gain A2 on the Withstand Pain Check. The prepared mana of a delayed spell is not subject to loss by a failed Withstand Pain Check.

## Maintaining Spells
Many spells have lingering effects that can last as long as you fuel the spell. A spell that can be maintained will either require more mana every round that you maintain it (that is every 6 seconds) or every day at dawn. The amount of mana and the interval of payment is listed in the spell’s description. To end a spell is a Swift Action but it must be done so consciously. 

Spells that are maintained every round require you to actively maintain them. Each round you must take the Maintain Spell Active Action or else the spell will fade at the end of the round. The mana required to maintain the spell is taken directly from your Mana Pool, so it does not reduce your MA. The maintenance for a daily spell is innate and does not require any action on your part since the spell is setup to automatically feed off your Mana Pool.

## Magic Projection
Magic Projection is your ability to control the mana used in a spell and how far away that control extends. This allows you to use your Magic Projection as an Offensive Skill to throw spells as projectiles, block an attack, or effect an area. When throwing a spell as a projectile your Magic Projection determines the maximum range, see the following table. The effective range is half the maximum. You are subject to all the penalties and bonuses with thrown projectiles except you cannot Aim. Once you reach Impossible with your Magic Projection, you can hit targets outside of line of sight if you can perfectly determine their location, such as Detect Ki or Spy of Light. At Inhuman, you can affect targets with only an approximate location. For example, you could target a creature as long as you know what floor of a house they are on.

### Projection Fumbles
When you cast a spell that requires a Magic Projection roll, you can Fumble. A Fumble level of 2 to 11 means the spell only fails and you lose the mana. A Fumble level of 12 or higher causes the spell to go wild, possibly hitting a different target or changing into a different spell entirely. The effect of a wild spell is left up to the GM.

A Fumble occurs on a Magic Projection roll for a maintained spell is treated normally for a Difficult or Opposed Skill Check.
