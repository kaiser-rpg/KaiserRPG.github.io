Mana is a mystical energy used to fuel spells and summon supernatural creatures. All beings that possess a spirit have a Mana Pool, which represents the current and total amount of mana that their spirit contains. If you possess The Gift, you have an additional ability called Mana Accumulation that lets you gather the mana from Mana Pool into the world and funnel it into a spell. 

Raw mana can be found in the world, with many occultists believing it to stem from the Veil.

## Mana Pool
Your maximum Mana Pool size is equal to twenty plus ten times your Focus Characteristic. To this you add any innate bonuses and mana purchased using Experience Points -- mana gained though XP comes in groups of fifty.

## Mana Accumulation
The Base Mana Accumulation is directly based on your Focus Characteristic -– as shown in the following table -– and the Base MA is then multiplied by your MA Multiple, which starts at zero. You can spend Experience Points to buy MA Multiples. So, after buying one MA Multiple, your MA will be equal to your Base MA; a second MA Multiple means your MA is twice your Base MA.

## Mana Recovery
Your Mana Pool regains mana naturally over time. Your spirit has an innate magnetism to draw the raw, ambient mana into your spirit for later use. Once every 24 hours and after 6 hours of rest, you regain a number of mana equal to your Mana Recovery. Your Mana Recovery is equal to your Base MA multiplied by the number of Mana Recovery and Mana Accumulation Multiples you have developed. Mana Recovery Multiple is always cheaper to develop than a Mana Accumulation Multiple since the MA Multiple also gives you a Mana Recovery Multiple.

Another way to regain mana could be from a creature with The Gift. Those with The Gift can transfer mana from their Pool to yours at a rate equal to their MA while they are in physical contract with you. This is a completely voluntary process; only very powerful spells allow a wizard to steal mana. 

Some special materials or artifacts are capable of storing mana for later use. As with transferring mana between wizards, these objects will accept mana from you until they hit their maximum.
