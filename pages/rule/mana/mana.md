Mana is a mystical energy used to fuel spells and summon supernatural creatures. All beings that possess a spirit have a Mana Pool, which represents the current and total amount of mana that their spirit contains. Those with the Gift have an additional ability called Mana Accumulation that lets them gather the mana from their pool to funnel it into a spell. 

## Mana Pool
Your maximum Mana Pool size is equal to twenty plus ten times your Focus Characteristic. To this you add any Innate Bonuses and mana purchased using Experience Points – mana gained though XP comes in groups of fifty.

## Mana Accumulation
The Base Mana Accumulation is directly based on your Focus Characteristic – as shown in the following table – and the Base MA is then multiplied by your MA Multiple, which starts at one. You can spend Experience Points to buy additional MA Multiples. Each time you increase the number by which you multiply your Base MA. So, after buying one MA Multiple, your MA will be twice your Base MA; a third Multiple means your MA is three times your Base.

## Mana Recovery
Your Mana Pool regains mana naturally over time until it reaches its maximum. Once every 24 hours, after 6 hours of rest you regain a number of mana equal to your Mana Recovery. Your Mana Recovery is equal to your Base MA multiplied by the number of Mana Recovery and Mana Accumulation Multiples you have developed. Mana Recovery Multiple is always cheaper to develop than a Mana Accumulation Multiple since the MA Multiple also gives you a Mana Recovery Multiple.

Another way to regain mana could be from a creature with the Gift. Those with the Gift can transfer mana from their Pool to yours at a rate equal to their MA while they are in physical contract with you. This is a completely voluntary process; only very powerful spells allow a wizard to steal mana. 

Some special materials or artifacts are capable of storing mana for later use. As with transferring mana between wizards, these objects will accept mana from you until they hit their maximum.
