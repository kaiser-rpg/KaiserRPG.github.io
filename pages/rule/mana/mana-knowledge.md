Mana knowledge (MK) is the measure of your capacity to understand the theory behind mana. Your maximum mana knowledge is determined by your [@stat Aptitude @] Characteristic, as listed in the following table. By investing 1 Experience Point, you can increase the maximum by 10 points. 

In order to invest mana knowledge, you must take time to train and study, much like a warrior learning a new weapon.

{% include meta.html content="Learning magic is a difficult process, even for those that are adept at doing so, and it is unlikely that someone just starting their adventure as a wizard will have reached their full intellectual potential right away. For that reason, it is recommended that the Game Master limit a character from the Caster Archetype to only invest half of their mana knowledge during character creation, and only a fourth for other archetypes. The character can invest the remainder of the MK, and any they gain after creation, during downtime." %}
