Mana knowledge (MK) is the measure of your capacity to understand the theory behind mana. Your maximum mana knowledge is determined by your Intelligence Characteristic, as listed in the following table. By spending 1 Experience Point, you can increase the maximum by 10 points. 

In order to spend Mana knowledge, you must take time to train and study, much like a warrior learning a new weapon.

{% include meta.html content="Learning magic is a difficult process, even for those that are adept at doing so, and it is unlikely that someone just starting their adventure as a wizard will have reached their full intellectual potential right away. For that reason, it is recommended that the Game Master limit a character from the Caster Archetype to only spend half of their mana knowledge during character creation, and only a fourth for other archetypes. The character can spend the remainder of the MK, and any they gain after creation, during downtime." %}

## Learning Spells
To learn how to cast a spell you must spend some amount of mana knowledge. 


Each path of magic has an antagonizing path that represents an entirely opposite school of thought, making it much more difficult to learn. For instance, Fire and Water are opposing paths since they each operate on entirely different parts of the world. If you wish to develop in a Path that opposes one of your current paths, it takes twice as much mana knowledge to do so. Necromancy is a special case; due to its nature it opposes all other Paths of Magic.

Once you start learning opposing Paths, the lower leveled path will have the increased cost. As a result, it is not recommended you keep them evenly leveled.

### Magic Instruction
Spending mana knowledge occurs during Downtime. Having an instructor or a tome detailing the spell you are currently learning will reduce the effort required.

### Choosing Specific Spells
You can choose to learn an individual spell without having mastered the underlying theory. This method of learning new spells allows you to choose any spell and pay a special cost for it. Higher level spells costs more mana knowledge since it requires you to understand a more complex topic without the underlying knowledge. The cost for each Spell Level Range is listed below. Spells from an opposing Path still have their cost doubled.
