## Totem
The most important part of any conjuring ritual is the totem. A totem is a complex object that represents a combination of knowledge and spiritual synergy with the creature to be conjured. Without any totem, it is impossible to perform any conjuration on a creature. 

### Gaining a Totem
Totems can be found or created during downtime. Once you possess a totem, you must spend six hours (one unit of downtime) per level of the totem to attune to it. Once fully attuned, you understand what type of creature the totem was designed for.

A totem can take nearly any shape the crafter desiers. Common examples include cards, dolls, dice, and books. 

When creating a totem, you must chose a level. If you are making a totem for a legendary creature, it must be the level of that creature (if that creature ever increases in level, so to does the totem). It costs you an amount of gold equal to the creatures level squared times 500. Specific creatures might have an additional cost or require a specific object when crafting it (such as the feather of a phonix for the Phonix King). Crafting the totem requires only time, so no skill checks. A totem can be upgraded or modified later.

Each totem you possess will be synconized with a certain type of creature creature will be syncronized with


Each ritual is different and might require expensive materials to be consumed while performing it. The Game Master will determine the cost for each ritual, but guidelines are provided later in this chapter. If a ritual is performed for longer than 18 hours, you can suspend it for a maximum of 8 hours as you sleep.
