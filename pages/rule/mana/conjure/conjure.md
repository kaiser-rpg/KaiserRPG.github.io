Mana has a curious property to allow you to use your spirit as a sort of portal to bring forth creatures from beyond the Veil. Opening this portal is no easy task, requiring a high degree of knowledge and a great deal of time allow you to synchronize your spirit with the Veil. But, unlike spells, conjuring a creature does not require the Gift, only a strength of spirit and sufficient mana. Since that creature is a being in and of itself, how it will interact with the world, and with you, is up to it. The ability to control a creature once here and send it back are further skills that will aid you as you delve into Veil Conjuration. Creatures pulled this way have a strong connection to the Veil, meaning you are unable to conjure natural creatures or those who are no longer tied to the Veil.
