Principles are modification to the generally understood thaumic theories. Mastering a principle is a purely mental exercise as you integrate it into your personal understanding of mana. Empowering your spells, quickening your summoning, and expanding the reach of your spirit are just a few examples of the power that principles hold.

Each Principle is broken up into four different trees: Casting, Conjuring, Invoking, and Manipulation. When you first decide to master a principle, choose one tree and start at its root node. Mastering a node requires you to invest some amount of mana knowledge and meet any Presence requirement. Additionally, you must have mastered a connecting node -- unless it is the root node. After mastering three principles in a tree, you can choose another tree's root node.

Some principles appear more than once in a given tree. You can master those principles multiple times, each time you gain a stronger benefit.
