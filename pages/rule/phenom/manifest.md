## Manifesting

{% include action/intention/phenom.md %}

## Failure and Blowback
Each time you manifest a phenom, there is a chance you are unable to control the energy and it backfires. Each phenomâ€™s description includes at least one degree that lists a Fatigue cost. These degrees represent your failure to manifest the phenom, so its effects do not occur, and you lose a number of Free Phenom Points equal to the number listed. Once you have no more PP, you start consuming Stamina Points. 

If your Stamina Points drops to 0 as a result of a failed phenom, you immediately fall unconscious and your mind suffers a great shock. All maintained phenom end and you must pass a PsR Check with a Difficulty of 10. You are in a coma for an hour for each Degree of Failure. The Difficulty increases by 1 for each Stamina Point that was unpaid. A Degree of Failure greater than 8 causes you to immediately die.

## Maintaining Phenom
Some phenom can be maintained, but doing so requires you to have purchased an Innate Slot for it. Each Innate Slot that you have for a phenom allows you to maintain another instance

To maintain a phenom, you must have an Innate Slot for it. Once you have successfully manifested a phenom, you can declare that you will maintain it using one of its open Innate Slots. Each round that the phenom is maintained, its effects persist at the highest degree that your Final Manifest Potential Value can achieve and you must take the Maintain Phenom Action. If your Final Manifest Potential Value is not high enough to achieve an effect, you cannot maintain that phenom. Each Innate Slot can only maintain one phenom, if you wish to maintain more than one instance of a phenom, you need to buy multiple Innate Slots for it.
