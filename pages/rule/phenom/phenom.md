Phenomenon, or phenom for short, are a latent weakness in reality that those with the right mental makeup can manifest. A phenom is powered by reality itself, meaning you only need to use your willpower to manifest the right weakness for reality to provide the fuel. Each phenom is ordered under a Discipline based on the types of energy it manipulates. For example, phenom that create and manipulate the elemental energies associated with fire belong to the Heat Discipline while the ability to read and control thoughts belongs to the Mind Discipline.

## Manifest Potential
Manifest Potential is the measure of your ability to open a weakness in reality to create a phenom. This potential can only be used to manifest phenom that you have already mastered. Your Manifest Potential's Base Skill Value is equal to your Willpower Characteristic minus four. This Final Manifest Potential Value is then used as part of a special Skill Check that is not opposed or difficult. Using your Final Skill Roll, determine the highest Degree of Difficulty it beats and that you have mastered. The phenom then manifests at that Degree of Difficulty. The action to manifest a phenom is listed in the phenom's description.

You can manifest more than one phenom per round. But doing so causes you to split your Manifest Potential. You can divide your Final Manifest Potential Value between multiple phenom, but you must give each Skill Check at least 1 point. This division must be declared before making your roll. Once you have used all your Manifest Potential, you cannot manifest any more phenom that round.

{% include example.html content="Sarah has a Final Manifest Potential Value of 5. So in a single round she could manifest one phenom with a +5 to the Skill Check. Or, she could manifest three phenom, two of them with a +2 and the last one with a +1." %}

## Phenom Projection
When a phenom targets a creature other than yourself or is used to prevent an attack, the Game Master might call for a Phenom Projection Skill Check. When you target another creature, your phenom travels like a thrown projectile with a maximum distance determined by your Final Phenom Projection Value. Phenom Projection Checks count as an Offensive Roll and are subject to all the penalties and bonuses for thrown projectiles except you cannot Aim. When used to defend yourself, you can use it as a Defensive Roll.

## Phenom Points
Phenom Points, also known as PP, are the fundamental units of proficiency with manifesting. These points can be spent to gain permanent and temporary benefits. You start with 1 PP and gain more by spending Experience or from your class's Innate Bonus.

Any PP not permanently spent are called Free PP. Free PP has several temporary uses. Their use does not consume the PP permanently. Any Free PP spent can be regained in time; you naturally regain 1 PP each hour.

### Permanent Phenom Point Use
Below is a list of ways to permanently spend PP, called burning PP. Each of these options, other than Master a Discipline, only affects one phenom of your choice. Burning PP requires downtime.

#### Master a Discipline
Before you can use any phenom, you need to master the discipline it belongs to. Mastering the Discipline burns 1 PP and gives you a maximum value of Routine (2) for each phenom.

{% include example.html content="Sarah wants to master the Heat Discipline. She burns 1 PP to do this but then she can manifest any phenom within Heat at Routine(2). But since all of the Heat phenom cause a Blowback at  Routine(2), she will need to increase their maximum degree first." %}

#### Increase a Phenom's Maximum Degree
With mastery of a Discipline, you can start to learn the phenom contained within it. Increasing a phenom's maximum degree by one burns 1 PP. Remember that once you master a Discipline, each phenom starts with a maximum degree of Routine(2).

{% include example.html content="Sarah has mastered the Heat Discipline, and wants to start investing in her phenom. Sarah spends 3 PP on the Create Fire phenom to increase is maximum degree." %}

#### Increase Innate Bonus to Manifest Potential
By spending Phenom Points, you can increase your Innate Bonus to Manifest Potential. The first +1 burns 1 PP. Each +1 after that costs one more PP than the previous. The table below gives the total PP cost for each bonus.

{% include example.html content="Sarah burns 1 PP to gain a +1 Innate Bonus to Manifest Potential. Next time she wants to increase the Innate Bonus by +1 will cost her 2 PP and then 3 PP." %}

#### Strengthen a Phenom
You can burn 1 PP to gain a +1 to the Manifest Potential Check for a single phenom. Each PP burned gives you a +1 bonus, to a maximum of +10. This bonus does not apply for maintained the phenom, only manifesting it. 

{% include example.html content="Sarah has the Immolation phenom, and would like to strengthen it by burning 4 PP. As a result, she has a +4 bonus whenever she rolls to manifest Immolation. With her +12 to Manifest Potential, she can either manifest it once and add +16 to the roll or she could split three ways, each roll gaining a +7." %}

#### Add Innate Slot to a Phenom
By burning 2 PP, you gain an Innate Slot for a phenom. This allows you to maintain one instance of the phenom, each additional Innate Slot can maintain another instance. You can gain an unlimited number of Innate Slots for each phenom.

#### Improve Maintained Phenom
You can burn 3 PP to increase the degree at which you maintain a phenom. This can only be purchased twice for each phenom but each increase affects all Innate Slots.

### Free Phenom Point Use
By using Free PP, you can gain temporary benefits to your manifesting abilities. Each of these options are done as part of the Action to Manifest a Phenom.

#### Increase Maximum Degree
You can temporarily increase the maximum degree of a phenom for one round by spending Free PP. Each Free PP spend allows you to use a phenom at one degree higher than you already know. You must have mastered the Routine(2) Degree of a phenom in order to use this.

#### Increase Potential
You can temporarily increase your Manifest Potential on one Manifest Potential Skill Check. For every 1 Free PP spend, you gain a +1 to the Manifest Potential Roll.

#### Increase Projection
You can temporarily increase your Phenom Projection on one Phenom Projection Skill Check. For every 1 Free PP spent, you gain a +1 to the Phenom Projection Roll.
