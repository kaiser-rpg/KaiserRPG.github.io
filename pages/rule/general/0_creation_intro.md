The first thing you need to do to play Kaiser is to create a character. This fictional individual will be the role you portray during the game. Your character is unique, based on the abilities and skills which you decide, created according to your preferences. It is important that you have a clear idea of the type of character you want to play, so that you can portray them to the fullest. Remember, characters are more than simply numbers and statistics on a piece of paper. Your actions and choices in the game will breathe life into each character you create.

Before we start creating a character, letâ€™s start with a brief explanation of the steps.

1. **Generate Characteristics**: There are eight different Characteristics and a few ways to generate them. Your GM will tell you which one to use.

2. **Choose your Race**: This will give you some skills that will get better as you gain levels or some unique abilities.

3. **Choose your Class**: This determines the cost of upgrading skills and buying new abilities.

4. **Buy Traits**: You can buy Positive Traits with Trait Points, commonly known as TP. You can gain some TP by taking Negative Traits.

5. **Spend Experience Points**: You have 60 Experience Points to spend. You can buy almost anything, but the cost is determined by your Class and certain Traits. There are a few restrictions on how many of one thing you can buy. This is the hardest part, but provides the greatest amount of diversity between characters.

6. **Fill in the Rest**: All that is left is to fill in the character sheet. The Innate Bonuses from your Race, Class, and Traits are all added. You will use all your choices from before to find the final value for your Skills, Life Points, and other values.

> To better understand the character creation process, we will provide examples throughout this chapter. The first thing to do is to choose a name and create a concept. The example we will follow is to create Ceil Light-caller.
