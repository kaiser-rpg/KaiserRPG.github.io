Not every outcome is known in Kaiser, even by the GM. To handle this outcome, Kaiser primarily uses two six-sided dice to find out what happens. Dice are referred to by the letter **d** followed by the number of sides. When more than one die is needed, a number is placed before the letter **d** to tell you how many to roll. Sometimes additional numbers are added to the sum of the dice rolled, these are usually noted after the letter **d**. 

For example, when you see 2d6 + 2. You would roll 2 six-sided dice and sum the results of both dice and then add two to get the final result.

The other type of roll that might be needed is a percentile or 1d100. This is done by rolling two d10s, with one designated as the tens place. A roll of two zeros equals a 100. 

## Types of Checks
In Kaiser, there are five types of checks you will generally make: Difficulty Characteristics Checks, Opposed Characteristics Checks, Difficulty Skill Checks, Opposed Skill Checks, and Resistance Checks. Each one serves a different purpose.

### Difficulty Characteristics Checks
These checks are made with a Characteristic. To make one, roll a 1d6 and add it to the Characteristic being checked. If the result is greater than or equal to the set Difficulty, you are successful.

### Opposed Characteristics Checks
Like Difficulty Characteristics Checks, these checks are made using your Characteristics but are opposed by another creature. To make one, roll a 1d6 and add it to the Characteristic being checked and the opposing creature will do the same. If your result is greater than the opposing result, you are successful.

### Difficulty Skill Checks 
These are made by rolling 2d6 and adding the results to a Skill. If the result is greater than or equal to the difficulty set by the GM, you are successful.

### Opposed Skill Checks
Like Difficulty Skill Checks, these are made by rolling 2d6 and adding the results to a Skill, but are opposed by another creature. If your result is greater than the opposing result, you are successful. These checks usually have a "defender" and "attacker" for the purpose of resolving ties.

### Resistance Checks
Resistance Checks are your capacity to avoid detrimental effects or status. There are five different Resistance Checks: Presence (PrR), Physical (PhR), Immune (IR), Spirit (SR), and Mental (MR). In order to pass a Resistance Check, you roll 2d6 and add the result to the Resistance being tested. If the final value is greater than or equal to the required difficulty, you have avoided the effect. A Resistance Check cannot have an Open Roll or a Fumble.

## Results
Compare the results of your roll to the difficulty or opposing creature to determine if you were successful.

### Success
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is greater than the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, the roll is successful. You have 1 Degree of Success (DoS) for each point above the target difficulty.

### Tie
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is equal to the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, a tie occurs. If the roll is a Difficulty Check, then the result is still a success and you have 1 Degree of Success (DoS). If it is an Opposed Check, a tie is given to the defender or is handled in a logical way. If no such logical conclusion occurs, each participant can roll an additional d6 and the higher roll is successful. If the roll is an Attack – a special type of Opposed Skill Check – a tie means the attack fails to connect with the target but the defender is unable to maneuver to make a Counter. 

### Failure
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is less than the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, the roll is a failure. You have 1 Degree of Failure for each point below the target difficulty.

## Degree of Success, Failure, and Difference
Sometimes knowing if a check was successful is enough. However, there are times when it is helpful to know by how much you have succeeded at a given task, or just how badly you failed. This is of particular importance for determining how much damage an attack deals, or if the defender can Counter.

How to determine the Degree of Success or Failure is mentioned in the success and failure section. Degree of Difference is the absolute value of Degree of Success and Failure. It is used in some tables when needing to describe what happens to the winner and loser of the roll. DoD can also be increased or reduced by some powers, meaning the Degree of Success and Failure are changed.

## Advantage and Disadvantage
Some situations have a more or less favorable outcome than normal, either due to environmental conditions or super-natural forces. In these circumstances, your roll is modified to be with Advantage or Disadvantage. Advantage means that when you roll a Skill Check or Resistance Check, roll an additional d6 and take the highest two rolls as your final roll. Disadvantage is you take the lowest two rolls as your final roll. 

In some circumstances, you can have more than one degree of Advantage or Disadvantage. When this occurs, roll an extra d6 for each level of Advantage or Disadvantage and take the highest or lowest respectively. The level of Advantage is noted as A1, A2, A#; the level of Disadvantage is noted as D1, D2, D#.

If you are affected by both Advantage and Disadvantage, subtract the lowest value from the higher one and that becomes your level of Advantage or Disadvantage.

If you do not have enough dice to roll at once, you can roll the initial 2d6. Then for each level of Advantage, reroll the lowest die. After all the levels of Advantage have been rolled for, or you have rolled double 6 – since that is the highest result possible – you are done. For Disadvantage, reroll the highest of the two dice. After all levels of Disadvantage have been rolled for, or you have rolled double 1 – since that is the lowest result possible – you are done. If this method is used, be aware of modified Fumble chances.

> For example, if a warrior has two levels of Advantage (A2) from having higher ground and being inspired by a spell but has given him three levels of Disadvantage (D3) from a curse spell, the warrior has one level of Disadvantage (D1) in the end (2 - 3 = -1). So, the warrior will roll three d6s and take the lowest two die as his roll.

### Open Rolls
Open Rolls represent something going unexpectedly well. When you make a Skill Check and roll double six, you have gained an Open Roll. You then roll another 1d6 and add the new result to the previous one. If the new 1d6 roll is also a six, repeat the process.

### Fumbles
In the same way you can have a great success by means of an Open Roll, the possibility exists that a Fumble occurs. When you make a Skill Check and roll a double one, you have Fumbled and the result is an immediate failure.

If the roll is for a Difficulty Skill Check, roll another 2d6 to determine the Fumble Level in the table below. The higher the fumble level, the worse the failure. 

Opposed Skill Checks that Fumble have a different effect. Instead you will subtract a value from your Skill. The Final Skill Total cannot be less than 0.

When a power increases or decreases the chance of a Fumble, refer to the table below. If you are affected by more than one increase and or decrease, add all the changes together.
