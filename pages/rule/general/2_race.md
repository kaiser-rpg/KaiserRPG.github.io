The next stage in character creation is choosing the characterâ€™s race. Your race is not one of ethnicity, but of a truly different species. [Chapter 2: Races](character_race_introduction.html) provides several races to choose from and the rules associated with their selection. Each race will have unique benefits and may cost some of your starting XP to use. Depending on your setting, the GM may limit the available races or provide new ones from the Optional Rules section.
