The first thing you need to do to play Kaiser is to create a character. This fictional individual will be the role you portray during the game. Your character is unique, based on the abilities and skills which you decide, created according to your preferences. It is important that you have a clear idea of the type of character you want to play, so that you can portray them to the fullest. Remember, characters are more than simply numbers and statistics on a piece of paper. Your actions and choices in the game will breathe life into each character you create.

Before we start creating a character, let’s start with a brief explanation of the steps.

**Generate Characteristics**: There are eight different Characteristics and a few ways to generate them. Your GM will tell you which one to use.

**Choose your Race**: This will give you some skills that will get better as you gain levels or some unique abilities.

**Choose your Class**: This determines the cost of upgrading skills and buying new abilities.

**Buy Traits**: You can buy Positive Traits with Creation Points, commonly known as CP. You can gain some CP by taking Negative Traits.

**Spend Development Points**: You have 60 Development Points to spend. You can buy almost anything, but the cost is determined by your Class and certain Traits. There are a few restrictions on how many of one thing you can buy. This is the hardest part, but provides the greatest amount of diversity between characters.

**Fill in the Rest**: All that is left is to fill in the character sheet. The Innate Bonuses from your Race, Class, and Traits are all added. You will use all your choices from before to find the final value for your Skills, Life Points, and other values.

> To better understand the character creation process, we will provide examples throughout this chapter. The first thing to do is to choose a name and create a concept. The example we will follow is to create Ceil Ligh-caller.

## Primary Characteristics
The starting point in creating your character is determining your Characteristics. Just as no two people are exactly alike, each character in the game has different Characteristics that represent the diversity of people who inhabit the world. 

### Characteristics
Kaiser has eight different Characteristics: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, Perception, Intelligence, Focus and Willpower. The first four deal with your physical abilities, while the last three represent your mental and spiritual capabilities. Perception is a mixed attribute, influenced by your physical and mental abilities. Each Characteristic must have a number. This number defines the quality of the ability in each area. The Characteristics of a human fall between 1 and 10, although in exceptional cases they can exceed these numbers.


#### Strength (STR)
Strength defines your musculature and energy. This Characteristic permits you to lift heavy weights, cause major damage when hitting, and break objects.

#### Dexterity (DEX)
Dexterity represents your physical skill and coordination. It affects your ability to make precise attacks, as well as to block them.

#### Agility (AGI)
Agility represents your speed of movement and balance. A high agility makes a you more acrobatic and able to dodge attacks. 

#### Constitution (CON)
Constitution defines your stamina and vitality, resistance to disease, and ability to absorb damage. A high Constitution score means you have good physical resistance and will recover from wounds and sickness. This Characteristic indicates the amount of damage you can suffer before dying.

#### Perception (PER)
This Characteristic encompasses the acuity of your senses, and the ability to notice what is going on around you. It represents the five senses, as well as instinct.

#### Intelligence (INT)
Intelligence covers reasoning, learning, and memory. Intellectual knowledge and logic depend on it, as does the capacity to understand and develop spells.

#### Focus (FC)
This represents your state of mind and spiritual power. The higher it is, the better your ability to influence and resist the supernatural, as well as stand out in a crowd.

#### Willpower (WP)
Willpower measures your mental strength and ability to remain cool under pressure. It is also used to employ and resist phenom.

### Modifier
Once you know your primary Characteristics, you can find each one’s Modifier. The Modifier is the number that increases or decreases all abilities and skills that rely on it. Depending on the value of the Characteristic, the Modifier is a positive or negative number, as indicated in following table.

{% include table-index.html index = "GEN2" %}


### Generating Characteristics

#### Method 1
You have 55 points to be divided freely among their eight Characteristics. Note that these points are independent of Development Points and Creation Points and are only used at character creation to generate characteristics. 

When a creating a character, each Characteristic must have a minimum value of three and cannot have a value higher than ten. Each point spent raises a Characteristic by one, however increasing any Characteristic from nine to ten costs two points. In campaigns where the characters are supposed to embody normal individuals, the total point value can be reduced to 45 points, while campaigns where character will eventually reach legendary status can award a total of 65 points to each character.

## Race
The next stage in character creation is choosing the character’s race. Race here does not refer to ethnicity, but rather to a true supernatural species with attributes distinct from human. The world of Kaiser is predominantly human, but if you wish, you can choose one of the other races detailed in Chapter 2. Each of those races has some supernatural elements that grant a special ability. For now, we will ignore them and focus on other aspects of character creation.

## Archetypes and Classes
Classes represent specialties a character has dedicated their life to studying – that is, the training and philosophy they have received to succeed in a specific profession. No one can simply decide one day to become an architect and then immediately start designing buildings. They must learn and practice for several years. A character, therefore, must undergo similar training so that they can function as a member of the class.

Before choosing a class, it is recommended that you choose an Archetype that interests you. Archetypes are prototypes, ideal models that encompass specific concepts about the class. There are six Archetypes, which include many classes:

**Fighter**: Fighter Archetypes specialize in armed and unarmed combat. They seek to perfect their combat abilities with unwavering commitment.

**Prowler**: Characters with this Archetype use subterfuge and wit to accomplish their objectives, preferring to avoid direct confrontation. Prowlers specialize in physical Secondary Skills.

**Domine**: Those individuals who specialize in the use of their spiritual energy, through which they can accomplish amazing actions. Domine seek to master the Ki abilities.

**Mystic**: This Archetype encompasses several classes which deal with the supernatural realm. Mystic characters can change reality through their spells or invoke the spirits of ancient creatures. They seek to master their magical abilities.

**Psychic**: This Archetype encompasses not only those characters gifted with psychic powers, but also those who have dedicated themselves to perfecting the psychic arts. Psychics seek mastery over all psychic abilities.

**Novel**: Characters with this particular Archetype have not specialized in anything specific during their apprenticeships and, therefore, have no specific preferences. Mundane humans – such as innkeepers and peasants, as well as more advanced professionals – fall in to this Archetype.

Now that we know what Archetypes are, it’s time to choose a Class. Having a Class does not mean that someone has dedicated themselves to a specific profession in the strictest sense. A Thief doesn’t necessarily support themselves by robbery, just as an Assassin needn’t solely go around killing people. Classes indicate the Development Costs of the character, limits on point distribution, and some of their special abilities. Detailed information on all of twenty Classes is found in Chapter 3.

If you look at the Classes carefully, you will see that some classes are listed under two different Archetypes. Some Classes have a dual nature and can fit into more than one Archetype. These are called Mixed Classes.

## Traits
The next step in bringing life to your character is to select your Traits. These Traits represent the uniqueness inherit to a person and are tied to their essence or nature. They are not learned or improved; you are either born with them or not. Complete details can be found in their Chapter.

## Development Points
Development Points (DP) are fundamental in the creation of your character, since they allow you to learn and continue to achieve greater mastery over their abilities. Unfortunately, DP are not limitless or unrestricted; you only have a specific number available to spend and a limit to how they are spent. Therefore, characters having a number of different Skills cannot really specialize in any. Conversely, highly specialized characters will not have the breadth of Skills that other more well-rounded characters might. 

For example, a Thief who dedicates almost all of their time to the Theft Skill has probably spent a great majority of their DP in that skill. However, in doing so they have neglected other areas – such as Stealth and Hide. Consequently, they will be better than other thieves in Theft, although their more balanced colleagues will possess greater skills in other areas.

Just as some people have a greater facility to learn while others must make much more effort to reach the same level, characters in Kaiser do not possess equal capabilities in improving their skills. This learning differential is represented in game by the concept of Development Costs. Development Costs are, essentially, ratings which determine how difficult abilities are to improve. In short, they indicate how much DP you must spend to improve a skill. The lower the Development Cost, the fewer DP you need to spend to learn or advance in a particular area. The value of these costs is determined by your Class, since it is easier to improve in one’s specialties. Logically, a Wizard will improve their mystical abilities at a lesser cost than a Warrior will, while the Warrior will learn combat skills more easily.

### First Level
Your level is a measure of power, indicating the strength of your abilities. The higher your level, the greater your powers since you have more DP to spend on improving. You begin the game at 1st level with 60 DP. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that your level refers solely to your combat abilities. Instead, it represents the potential that you have realized in this world.

### Development Cost
Development Cost is the amount of DP you must spend to increase a skill by 1 point. This cost is usually between 3 and 5 points. 

Some abilities have different increase rates. Mana, the resource used for magical spells, increases in increments of 50. Other abilities, such as Magic Accumulation and Ki, grant special benefits that are improved in different ways. We will discuss these special cases in greater detail in each of the sections dedicated to them.

### Spending Groups
Development Point expenses and Innate Bonuses are combined into discreet Groups and these Groups can also contain smaller Groups. This organization is used to help you track your purchases and the limits on them. The highest-level Groups in Kaiser are General, Primary, and Secondary. The General Group contains Innate Bonuses and expenses such as Life Point Multiples. The Primary Group is made up of three smaller Groups: Martial, Magic, Psychic. Expenses under these groups have limitations, discussed in the next section. Primary Skills are usually only used in combat. Lastly, there is the Secondary Group which contains the following groups: Athletics, Social, Perceptive, Intellectual, Vigor, Subterfuge, and Creative. These groups contain all the Secondary Skills you will need to perform any non-combat action.

### Spending Limits
There is a limit to the number of DP you can spend in each of your three Primary Groups: Martial, Magic, and Psychic. Besides listing Development Costs, each Class has a different limit to the Development Points you can spend on each Primary Group. For example, a 1st level Summoner possesses a 50% limit for the Martial Group, so they can only invest 30 DP in it at 1st level. The Summoner also has a 60% in the Magic Group, meaning they can invest up to 36 DP at 1st level.

### Limit on Martial
In addition to the limits to DP distribution that we have explained above, there is another general limitation that applies to all classes; limits to Attack, Block, and Dodge Skills. You can never spend more than 40% of your total DP on Attack, Block, and Dodge. 

Additionally, Attack, Block, and Dodge cannot have more than 25% of your total DP invested in it. Therefore, if you invest 25% in Attack then you only have 15% left for the other skills. 

Lastly, you are unable to invest DP in both Block and Dodge. Instead, when you spend DP to raise the Base Value on one of those skills, the other one's Base Value will be 6 points behind. Each Skill will add the Innate Bonuses and Characteristic Modifier separately so the Final Skill Value might be more or less than 6 point apart.

> For example, Ciel is spending DP on her Dodge Skill. She has spent enough DP to gain 10 points in Dodge and as a result, she is considered to have gained 4 points in Block as well. To Dodge she adds her +2 from Agility Modifier and a +1 from Innate Bonuses, giving her a Final Skill Value of 13. For Block, she adds her +1 from Dexterity Modifier but no Innate Bonus since her Class does not grant one. The Final Skill Value for Block ends up at 5 (4 points from DP and 1 point from Dexterity Modifier).

### Limit on Magic and Psychic
Magic and Psychic Projection have a similar limit as the Martial Group's Attack Skill. You cannot spend more than 20% of your total DP on each Projection Skill.

## Final Steps
All that remains are a few final steps.

### Derived Characteristics
Once you have your Characteristics and Skills, you can calculate the derived characteristics.

#### Movement Value
Movement Value represents the maximum speed at which you can run. It is equivalent to the Agility Characteristic: if you have an Agility of 7, your movement value is also 7. 

To know how far you can cover, consult the table below. The distance listed there is the maximum distance you can run in one Movement Action, and thus one round. Your Movement Value can be modified by having a high Athletics Skill.

{% include table-index.html index = "GEN3" %}

#### Size
Size indicates your expected height and weight. To calculate it, add your Strength and Constitution Characteristics. 

> For example, a character with an 8 and 7 in those Characteristics would have a size score of 15. 

For a recommended height and weight of the character, consult the following table and choose a number between those given for the appropriate size.

{% include table-index.html index = "GEN4" %}

### Innate Bonuses
As the result of your Race, Traits, and Class, some of your skills and abilities will improve without having to spend DP. These Innate Bonuses are added at 1st level and again at each level increment noted for the Race or Class.

#### Class Bonuses
Each Class has an Innate Bonus for Life Points and Initiative. These are added each time you gain a level.

#### Limitation to Martial Class Bonuses
Some Classes gain an Innate Bonus of +1 every other level in Attack, Block, or Dodge Skills. Whereas improvement in other skills has no limit, the Class increase for Attack, Block, and Dodge can never be greater than +5, that is to say, ten levels of Class Innate Bonuses. Even if you change Classes, this limit applies.

### Life Points
Life points indicate your resistance to wounds and the amount of damage you can suffer before receiving a critical wound. When you reach 0 Life Points, you may die.

The base Life Point score is based on Constitution. The base number for all living things is 20 points, to which you add your Constitution multiplied by 10. To this number you should add your Class’s Innate Bonus.

You can increase your Life Points by investing in Life Point Multiplies, the cost of which is determined by your Class. Each time you buy a multiple, you can increase your Life Points by your Constitution. Essentially, each purchase adds 1 to the original 10 that your Constitution is multiplied by.

{% include equation.html eq = "Final LP = 20 + (Constitution × (10 + LP Mult. Purchased)) + Innate LP Bonus" %}

### Initiative
The base Initiative of a normal-sized character is always 10. To calculate the final initiative value, add your Dexterity and Agility Modifiers. Finally, add your Innate Bonus from your Class.

### Presence and Resistance
Presence is the sum of all of your existential aspects – both physical and spiritual. You have an almost unlimited potential to develop your abilities; the more developed, the greater the Presence. Your Presence starts at 3 and increases by +1 every odd level.

In Kaiser, there are five types of Resistance, each one protecting you against a different type of negative effect. Resistance values are calculated by adding your Presence to the applicable modifier.

The five types of resistance are:

**Presence (PrR)**: This is the sum of your existence. This is not affected by any Characteristics.

**Physical Resistance (PhR)**: Represents your tolerance for damage and shock. PhR allows a you to avoid falling unconscious and overcome the effects of a Critical blow. Based on Constitution.

**Immune Resistance (IR)**: Represents your ability to avoid falling ill or being affected by a disease and poisons. IR also indicates how quickly they can recuperate from an illness. Based on Constitution.

**Spirit Resistance (SR)**: Represents how well you can resist the effects of a spell or of an ability of supernatural origin. Based on Focus.

**Mental Resistance (MR)**: Represents your force of will which allows them to resist psychic attacks and any mind-altering abilities. Based on Willpower.

### Primary and Secondary Groups
Your knowledge and expertise in certain tasks are known as Skills. Each Skill has a number of points that represent the sum of your natural talent and training. These Skills are broken up into Primary and Secondary Groups. Skills in the Primary Groups are further divided into the Martial, Magic, and Psychic Groups. The Secondary Groups are also divided into Groups, things like Exertion, Intellectual, and Creative. More detail can be found in Chapter 4.

#### Primary Groups
Primary Groups represent your basic faculties and are divided into three areas: Martial, Magic, and Psychic. Each of these encompass a series of skills and abilities related to its specialty.

##### Martial Group
These abilities encompass the fighting skills. When appropriate, add the corresponding Characteristic Modifier when calculate the Final Skill Value. Martial Skills are the following:

**Attack Skill**: This represents your ability to reach your opponent and get past their guard to inflict damage. This skill depends on Dexterity.  The first time you spend DP to increase your Attack Skill, you can choose a single weapon to become proficient with.

**Block Skill**: This represents your defensive ability – namely, how well you can deflect or stop attacks from hitting. This skill depends on Dexterity.

**Dodge Skill**: This represents your skill to move out of the way of an attack. This skill depends upon the Agility Characteristic.

**Wear Armor Skill**: This represents your ability to wear heavy armor without penalty or restrictions. This ability depends on Strength.

**Combat Modules**: This represents your knowledge and capability with various weapons and combat styles.

**Martial Arts**: This represents your knowledge and mastery of various unarmed combat styles.

**Domine Abilities**: This represents your ability to use spiritual energy in physical ways. Ki, Chakra, and Ki Techniques are also included under Domine Abilities.

##### Magic Group
Magic skills encompass all mythical knowledge and arts. Classes with magic powers – such as wizards, summoners, and trickster – utilize these abilities in the course of their adventures.

**Mana**: This represents your total magic points. These points determine the number of spells and other magical affects you can control.

**Mana Accumulation**: This ability represents your ability to gather your mana to weave magic and cast spells.

**Mana Recovery**: This ability represents your ability to gather your mana back into your spirit.

**Magic Projection Skill**: This represents your ability to project spells and aim them at a desired target. This skill depends upon the Dexterity Characteristic.

**Summon Skill**: This represents your capacity to bring supernatural creatures into the world. This skill depends upon your Focus Characteristic.

**Control Skill**: This represents your capacity to control supernatural beings. Control depends upon the Willpower Characteristic.

**Bind Skill**: This represents your capacity to trap the essence of mystical beings inside objects or persons. Bind depends upon the Focus Characteristic.

**Banish Skill**: This represents your ability to expel supernatural beings from this plane of reality. It depends upon the Focus Characteristic.

**Mystical Modules**: This represents your capacity to utilize magic and spells in new or more efficient ways.

**Meta Magic**: These are modifications to your magic or your spells.

##### Psychic Group
Psychic abilities cover everything related to the area of psychic powers, known as phenom, and their uses. Classes gifted with phenom – such as mentalists – utilize these abilities in the course of their adventures.

**Psychic Projection Skill**: This represents your capacity to project your mental powers at a target. This skill depends upon your Dexterity.

**Psychic Points (PP)**: These represents points used to develop and utilize your psychic phenom.

**Psychic Potential**: This is a special value that can only be increased by spending PP, as opposed to spending DP. It is based on your Willpower.

**Psychic Modules**: This represents your capacity to utilize phenom in new or more efficient ways.

#### Secondary Groups
Naturally, you possess much more complexity than simply being able to fight or cast spells. These are known as Secondary Skills and each one is part of a Secondary Group and is linked to a specific Characteristic. For example, the Acrobatics Skill is in the Exertion Group and depends upon your Agility, while Sciences fall under the Intellectual Group and depend upon Intelligence. You will find a complete description of Secondary Skills in Chapter 4.

#### Calculating and Using Skills
To calculate your final Primary or Secondary Skill, add the Base Value (what you get by spending Development Points) to the Modifier of the Characteristic tied to that Skill. Lastly, add any other special modifiers like Innate Bonuses from your Race and Class. The result will be the Final Skill Value, the number added to Skill Check rolls (discussed more fully in Chapter 4). 

### Final Details
Now that you know all the basic things needed to create your character, you can fill in your character sheet. Keep in mind that the Races, Classes, and Traits Chapters will provide the remaining fine details.

Below is a final check list of things you need to do to create your character:
1.	Generate Characteristics
2.	Choose Race
3.	Choose Class
4.	Buy Traits
5.	Spend DP
6.	Add Innate Bonuses
7.	Calculate Derived Characteristics
8.	Calculate Life Points
9.	Calculate Initiative
10.	Calculate Presence and Resistance
11.	Calculate final value for Primary Skills
12.	Calculate final value for Secondary Skills

## Gaining Levels
In order to advance in levels, you need to reach a milestone that marks your advancement. When you have earned the necessary experience, you gain a new level and 10 more DP, which you can use to obtain new abilities and skill or improve those you already possess.

In order to raise a level, you must take steps similar to those used to create a character. First, you should spend the new DP following the same restrictions as character creation. You can decide to not spend all of your DP gained, saving some for later. But you will not be able to spend these points until you have sufficient downtime.

After spending DP, make sure to increase your Innate Bonuses where appropriate. If the new level is odd, your Presence, and your other Resistances, also increases by 1 point.

### Increase Characteristics
At each even level, you can add 1 point to one of your Characteristics. This increase represents your natural progression, your inherent capacity to improve. 

When one of your Characteristics increase, it is possible that it modifies some other aspect. If the new Characteristic has a different Modifier from the previous one, you should change it and recalculate your Final Skill Values. If an ability relies on the Base Characteristic value, like Life Points, be sure to also increase the related value.

### Level Up Checklists
Below is a final check list of things you need to do to level your character up:
1.	Spend the new 10 DP
2.	If it is an even level, add +1 to one Characteristic
3.	If it is an odd level, add +1 to Presence
4.	Increase Innate Bonuses from your Race, Class, and Traits
5.	Recalculate any values that changed
