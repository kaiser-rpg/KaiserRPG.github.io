The web site in front of you is an instruction manual for playing the Kaiser Roleplaying Game, Kaiser RPG. The player, you, will portray a character using the rules laid out on this site. When you play a game, it is not necessary to memorize all the rules, just be sure to be familiar with the ones that effect your character.

Once you finish reading this page, we recommend reading the Character Creation chapter

## Playing Kaiser
This website is the first item you will need before you start playing Kaiser. The only other thing required is a pair of six-sided dice and a set of percentile dice. You can get by with sharing dice between players, but it is recommended that each player and the GM have a pair or more of dice.

Players will need a writing utensil and paper on which to write their characters' abilities. You can find a character sheet [here](todo.html) to make keeping track of each character easier. Lastly, a miniature or token that can be used to represent your location during conflict can enrich the game.

The GM will require this site so they understand the rules of the game. After that, it is up to their imagination. Notes on what can happen during a game, what has happened in the past, and what the players face right now is handy but can be improvised if that is the style of game.

## Basic Game Mechanics
This section summarizes some of the essential rules of Kaiser. Later chapters will expand on these topics but understanding how dice rolls work is important.

### The Flow of the Game
Kaiser has a circular flow. Before the players can decide to do anything, the GM needs to describe what is around them. This can include any details the GM deems necessary but the players should be encouraged to explore and ask questions. Once the surrounds have been understood, it is up to the players to describe how they interact with it. If that outcome of interaction has a chance of an unintended outcome or is contested by some other entity then a check is required. If the result of the check is high enough, the outcome is successful. If it is not, the result is not achieved as described. But that does not mean some version of the result does not happen, just that the circumstances change, as directed by the GM. Either result, the GM needs to describe what is around the players once again, usually only mentioning what has changed or been discovered. Then the players describe what they do next and the cycle continues.
