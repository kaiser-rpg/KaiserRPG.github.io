The website in front of you is an instruction manual for playing the Kaiser Roleplaying Game, Kaiser RPG. The player, you, will portray a character using the rules laid out on this site. When you play a game, it is not necessary to memorize all the rules, just be sure to be familiar with the ones that effect your character.

Once you finish reading this page, it is recommended that you read the Character Creation section

## Playing Kaiser
This website is the first item you will need before you start playing Kaiser. The only other thing required is a pair of six-sided dice and a set of percentile dice. You can get by with sharing dice between players, but it is recommended that each player and the GM have a pair or more of dice.

Players will need a writing utensil and paper on which to write their characters' abilities. You can find a character sheet [here](todo.html) to make keeping track of each character easier. Lastly, a miniature or token that can be used to represent your location during conflict can enrich the game.

The GM will require this site so they understand the rules of the game. After that, it is up to their imagination. Notes on what can happen during a game, what has happened in the past, and what the players face right now is handy but can be improvised if that is the style of game.

## Basic Game Mechanics
This section summarizes some of the essential rules of Kaiser. Later chapters will expand on these topics but understanding how dice rolls work is important.

### The Flow of the Game
Kaiser has a circular flow. Before the players can decide to do anything, the GM needs to describe what is around them. This can include any details the GM deems necessary but the players should be encouraged to explore and ask questions. Once the surrounds have been understood, it is up to the players to describe how they interact with it. If that outcome of interaction has a chance of an unintended outcome or is contested by some other entity then a check is required. If the result of the check is high enough, the outcome is successful. If it is not, the result is not achieved as described. But that does not mean some version of the result does not happen, just that the circumstances change, as directed by the GM. Either result, the GM needs to describe what is around the players once again, usually only mentioning what has changed or been discovered. Then the players describe what they do next and the cycle continues.

## Dice Rolls

Not every outcome is known in Kaiser, even by the GM. To handle this outcome, Kaiser primarily uses two six-sided dice to find out what happens. Dice are referred to by the letter **d** followed by the number of sides. When more than one die is needed, a number is placed before the letter **d** to tell you how many to roll. Sometimes additional numbers are added to the sum of the dice rolled, these are usually noted after the letter **d**. 

For example, when you see 2d6 + 2. You would roll 2 six-sided dice and sum the results of both dice and then add two to get the final result.

The other type of roll that might be needed is a percentile or 1d100. This is done by rolling two d10s, with one designated as the tens place. A roll of two zeros equals a 100. 

### Types of Checks
In Kaiser, there are five types of checks you will generally make: Difficulty Characteristics Checks, Opposed Characteristics Checks, Difficulty Skill Checks, Opposed Skill Checks, and Resistance Checks. Each one serves a different purpose.

#### Difficulty Characteristics Checks
These checks are made with a Characteristic. To make one, roll a 1d6 and add it to the Characteristic being checked. If the result is greater than or equal to the set Difficulty, you are successful.

#### Opposed Characteristics Checks
Like Difficulty Characteristics Checks, these checks are made using your Characteristics but are opposed by another creature. To make one, roll a 1d6 and add it to the Characteristic being checked and the opposing creature will do the same. If your result is greater than the opposing result, you are successful.

#### Difficulty Skill Checks 
These are made by rolling 2d6 and adding the results to a Skill. If the result is greater than or equal to the Degree of Difficulty set by the Game Master, you are successful. The Degree of Difficulty can be seen in the following table.

{% include table-index.html table="gameplay" index="900" %}

#### Opposed Skill Checks
Like Difficulty Skill Checks, these are made by rolling 2d6 and adding the results to a Skill, but are opposed by another creature. If your result is greater than the opposing result, you are successful. These checks usually have a "defender" and "attacker" for the purpose of resolving ties.

#### Resistance Checks
Resistance Checks are your capacity to avoid detrimental effects or status. There are five different Resistance Checks: Presence (PrR), Physical (PhR), Immune (IR), Spirit (SR), and Mental (MR). In order to pass a Resistance Check, you roll 2d6 and add the result to the Resistance being tested. If the final value is greater than or equal to the required Degree of Difficulty, you have avoided the effect. A Resistance Check cannot have an Open Roll or a Fumble.

### Results
Compare the results of your roll to the difficulty or opposing creature to determine if you were successful.

#### Success
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is greater than the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, the roll is successful. You have 1 Degree of Success (DoS) for each point above the target difficulty.

#### Tie
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is equal to the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, a tie occurs. If the roll is a Difficulty Check, then the result is still a success and you have 1 Degree of Success (DoS). If it is an Opposed Check, a tie is given to the defender or is handled in a logical way. If no such logical conclusion occurs, each participant can roll an additional d6 and the higher roll is successful. If the roll is an Offensive Roll – a special type of Opposed Skill Check – a tie means the attack fails to connect with the target but the defender is unable to maneuver to make a Counter. 

#### Failure
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is less than the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, the roll is a failure. You have 1 Degree of Failure for each point below the target difficulty.

### Degree of Success, Failure, and Difference
Sometimes knowing if a check was successful is enough. However, there are times when it is helpful to know by how much you have succeeded at a given task, or just how badly you failed. This is of particular importance for determining how much damage an attack deals, or if the defender can Counter.

How to determine the Degree of Success or Failure is mentioned in the success and failure section. Degree of Difference is the absolute value of Degree of Success and Failure. It is used in some tables when needing to describe what happens to the winner and loser of the roll. DoD can also be increased or reduced by some powers, meaning the Degree of Success and Failure are changed.

### Modifiers to Rolls


#### Factors
When a situation is outright easier or harder is represented by a factor, split into bonus and penalty. As you will find in later sections, there are many kinds but not all of them are created equally. Below is a list of common factors you will encounter and how they combine or stack with the same kind.

**All-action**: An all-action factors are special, they apply to all Skill Checks that you make. When you are subject to multiple all-action factors, each one applies to the roll.

**Innate**: Innate bonuses are ones gained every level, or several levels. All sources of innate bonuses stack and are considered part of your Final Value. In some cases, innate bonuses do not increase with your level, martial arts grant a one time bonus and your Potential's innate bonus is increased by investing Phenom Points.

**Natural**: Natural factors usually come from features, meaning they are permanent. All natural factors stack and are considered part of your Final Value. 

**Deed**: Deed factors come from states, maneuvers, and other environmental factors. All deed factors stack and are added to your Final Roll.

**Power**: Power factors come from powers and are temporary and are added to the Final Roll, not to the Final Value. You take the highest power bonus and the lowest power penalty.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage
Some situations have a more or less favorable outcome than normal, either due to environmental conditions or super-natural forces. In these circumstances, your roll is modified to be with Advantage or Disadvantage. Advantage means that when you roll a Skill Check or Resistance Check, roll an additional d6 and take the highest two rolls as your final roll. Disadvantage is you take the lowest two rolls as your final roll. 

In some circumstances, you can have more than one degree of Advantage or Disadvantage. When this occurs, roll an extra d6 for each degree of Advantage or Disadvantage and take the highest or lowest respectively. The degree of Advantage is noted as A1, A2, A#; the degree of Disadvantage is noted as D1, D2, D#.

If you are affected by both Advantage and Disadvantage, subtract the lowest degree from the higher one and that becomes your degree of Advantage or Disadvantage.

If you do not have enough dice to roll at once, you can roll the initial 2d6. Then for each degree of Advantage, reroll the lowest die. After all the degrees of Advantage have been rolled for, or you have rolled double 6 -- since that is the highest result possible -- you are done. For Disadvantage, reroll the highest of the two dice. After all degrees of Disadvantage have been rolled for, or you have rolled double 1 -- since that is the lowest result possible -- you are done. If this method is used, be aware of modified Fumble chances.

{% include example.html content="For example, Ceil making an Attack against a bandit, she has one degree of Advantage (A2) from having the Higher Ground State over her opponent but is granted three levels of Disadvantage (D3) as a result of an opponent's power. When she rolls for her Strike Skill, she ends up having one degree of Disadvantage (2 - 3 = 1). So she rolls three d6s and takes the lowest two dice as the roll." %}

### Core Terminology
Below are a few terms that you will see throughout this system. They will help define how numbers interact.

**Base Value**: This number is your core value. Your Base Characteristic Value is your unmodified Characteristic. Base Skill Value is what you have gained by spending Experience Points. Base Resistance Value is equal to your Presence.

**Final Value**: This number if your Base Value along with some permanent factors. Your Final Characteristic Value is usually unchanged since there are no permanent factors that will modify it -- most changes are either power factors or a change to your Base Value. Final Skill Value and Final Resistance Value add the Characteristic Modifier (which is determined by your Final Characteristic Value), your natural factors, and any innate bonus. This Final Value is used to determine if you meet the requirements for certain abilities and is what is added to your Roll.

**Base Roll**: This number if your Final Value and the roll of a 2d6. There are no factors that modify this number. If you are subject to Advantage or Disadvantage, they can change your roll. If an ability states that you halve the penalty of something that gives you, you halve the Disadvantage, round up.

**Final Roll**: This is the sum of your Base Roll and any other factors. Deed and power factors are added here.
