### Mana and Accumulation
Mana is a mystical energy used to fuel spells and summon supernatural creatures. All beings that possess a spirit have a Mana Pool, which represents the current and total amount of mana that their spirit can contain. Those with the Gift have an additional ability called Mana Accumulation that lets them gather the mana from their pool to funnel it into a spell. 

Your maximum Mana Pool size is equal to twenty plus ten times your Focus Characteristic. To this you add any Innate Bonuses and mana purchased using Experience Points – mana gained though XP comes in groups of fifty.

The Base Mana Accumulation is directly based on your Focus Characteristic – as shown in the following table – and the Base MA is then multiplied by your MA Multiple, which starts at one. You can spend Experience Points to buy additional MA Multiples. Each time you increase the number by which you multiply your Base MA. So, after buying one MA Multiple, your MA will be twice your Base MA; a third Multiple means your MA is three times your Base.

### Mana Recovery
Your Mana Pool regains mana naturally over time until it reaches its maximum. Each dawn you regain a number of Mana equal to your Mana Recovery. Your Mana Recovery is equal to your Base MA multiplied by the number of Mana Recovery and Mana Accumulation Multiples you have developed. Mana Recovery Multiple is always cheaper to develop than a Mana Accumulation Multiple since the MA Multiple also gives you a Mana Recovery Multiple.

Another ways to regain mana could be from creatures with the Gift. Those with the Gift can transfer mana from their Pool to yours at a rate equal to their MA while they are in physical contract with you. This is a completely voluntary process; only very powerful spells allow a wizard to steal mana. 

Some special materials or artifacts are capable of storing mana for later use. As with transferring mana between wizards, these objects will accept mana from you until they hit their maximum.

### Spells and Mana
If you have the Gift, then you can cast any spell you know. Each spell has a Mana Cost and an Intelligence Requirement. The Mana Cost is how much mana you must have accumulated and then spend at the moment of casting. The Intelligence Requirement must be meet in order to understand how a spell works. Spells also have an Action Requirement of Involved or Free depending on the nature of the spell. Involved Spells require it to be your turn in the Initiative, while Free Spells can be cast at any time during the round. As long as you meet all the requirements for the spell – those requirements being the accumulated mana, sufficient intelligence, and the proper action – you can cast it. Complete description of spells can be found in the Spell Section later in this chapter.

To be able to manipulate mana, whether that be accumulation or transfer, you must declare your Intention before rolling Initiative. There are four Magic Intentions and each round you can only take one of them. The four options are: Accumulate Pure Mana, Accumulate for a Prepared Spell, Transfer Mana, and Cast an Innate Spell.

#### Accumulate a Mass of Mana
When you declare this Intention, you accumulate mana from your Mana Pool equal to your MA. If you are unable to perform somatic or verbal components, your MA is halved, or quartered if you cannot perform either component. If you take no other Intention or Action this round, you can gain the benefit of your MA again at the end of the round, all modifiers apply.

By accumulating a mass of mana, you have no clear goal for its expense. You simply pull the mana from your Pool into the world until you find a spell that is appropriate for the current situations. This mass of mana can be used to cast any number of spells in a single round as long as you have mana to spend. At the end of the round that you cast any spell with your mass of mana, all the remaining mana returns to your Pool.

If you have a mass of mana from the previous round and do not take the Accumulate a Mass of Mana Intention again, your mass of mana will return to your Pool before rolling Initiative. Due to the stress of the mana returning without a proper outlet, you lose 10 mana from your Pool. Alternatively, you can choose to transform the mass of mana into a prepared spell. See Accumulate for a Prepared Spell for more details.

> Ceil has been Accumulating Pure Mana for four turns. On the start of the fifth turn she has 150 mana available. On her turn she casts Create Light for 20 points, Shield of Light of 50 points, and Induce Calm for 40. The total comes to 110 points, which means she has 40 points remaining. She can use these points to cast another spell or they will return to her pool at the end of the round. Since she had a controlled mana release, she does not lose 10 points. Next round she can start accumulating mana again, starting at zero.

#### Accumulate for a Prepared Spell
When you declare this Intention, you must also declare a spell and all its options to be prepared for casting. You then accumulate mana from your Mana Pool equal to your MA. If you are unable to perform somatic or verbal components, your MA is halved, or quartered if you cannot perform either component. If you take no other Intention or Action this round, you can gain the benefit of your MA again at the end of the round, all modifiers apply.

Any mana accumulate this way can only be used for the prepared spell. Once the Mana Cost is accumulated, you can cast the spell or you can delay casting the prepared spell for a number of rounds equal to your Focus Characteristic. If you have not cast the prepared spell before the last round that you can delay, the prepared mana returns to your Pool and you lose 10 mana.

While delayed, the prepared mana is not subject to losing concentration from damage and the prepared spell can be cast when you have the appropriate action. Each round you will still have to perform the Maintain Mana Action on your turn since the mana you hold is still unstable. Additionally, you do not have to take the Accumulate for a Prepared Spell Intention with the same spell and options since the spell is already fully prepared. You can declare any other Magic Intention, even starting another Prepared Spell.

If you have prepared mana from the previous round and do not take the Accumulate for a Prepared Spell Intention with the same spell and options, your prepared mana will return to your Pool before rolling Initiative. Due to the stress of the mana returning without a proper outlet, you lose 10 mana from your Pool.

If you have a mass of mana from the previous round, when you declare the Accumulate for a Prepared Spell you can convert that mass of mana into prepared mana. Any excess returns to your Pool. 

#### Transfer Mana
When you declare this Intention, as a Free Action you can push an amount of mana up to your Mana Accumulation from your Pool to that of another. This transference requires you to be in direct contact with the creature or object with a Mana Pool. You can transfer mana to several different targets as long as the total mana transferred out of your Pool in a round is less than or equal to your MA.

If you are in contact with a Mana Battery, you can instead pull mana from it. Pulling and pushing mana both have a shared maximum per round equal to your MA.

> For Example, Ceil has an MA of 50. In a single round, she can push 20 mana to Balrog and pull 30 mana from her Mana Battery. She must be in contact with both Balrog and the Mana Battery at some point during the round. But since she took this Intention, she cannot take any other Magic Intentions and thus cannot cast a spell.

#### Cast an Innate Spell
When you declare this Intention, you gather an amount mana from the environment, called innate mana, in order to cast a spell, called an innate spell. The amount of innate mana you can pull from the environment is determined by your MA, but can also be modified by places with strong or weak ambient mana. You can then cast a single spell whose Mana Cost is no greater than that innate mana. 

Innate mana is very limited in its use due to its raw nature. You are completely unable to accumulate or store it, each round you only have access to what your MA and the environment allow. Even if the amount of innate mana is enough to cast two different spells, only one can be cast. Innate mana cannot be absorbed into your Pool or a Mana Battery — that is what your Mana Recovery is for. You are able to maintain an innate spell, but while doing so you cannot cast another innate spell since the innate mana is already being used.

### Damage During Accumulation
When you suffer damage, you might lose concentration on the mana you have accumulated. You must make a Withstand Pain Difficulty Check equal to one fifth of the damage. Each Degree of Failure causes 10 mana to return to your Mana Pool from what you have accumulated. If you have more then 10 DoF, the mana is lost instead of returned to your Pool. 

If you took the Accumulate for a Prepared Spell Intention, then you gain A2 on the Withstand Pain Check. The prepared mana of a delayed spell is not subject to loss by a failed Withstand Pain Check.
