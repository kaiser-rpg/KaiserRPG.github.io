The web site in front of you is an instruction manual for playing the Kaiser Roleplaying Game, Kaiser RPG. The player, you, will portray a character using the rules laid out on this site. When you play a game, it is not necessary to memorize all the rules, just be sure to be familiar with the ones that effect your character.

## Playing Kaiser
This website is the first item you will need before you start playing Kaiser. The only other thing required is a pair of six-sided dice and a set of percentile dice. You can get by with sharing dice between players, but it is recommended that each player and the GM have a pair or more of dice.

Players will need a writing utensil and paper on which to write their characters’ abilities. You can find a character sheet [here](TODO) to make keeping track of each character easier. Lastly, a miniature or token that can be used to represent your location during conflict can enrich the game.

The GM will require this site so they understand the rules of the game. After that, it is up to their imagination. Notes on what can happen during a game, what has happened in the past, and what the players face right now is handy but can be improvised if that is the style of game.

## Basic Game Mechanics
This section summarizes some of the essential rules of Kaiser. Later chapters will expand on these topics but understanding how dice rolls work is important.

### The Flow of the Game
Kaiser, like many RPGs, has a circular flow. Before the players can decide to do anything, the GM needs to describe what is around them. This can include as few details as the GM deems necessary but the players should be encouraged to explore and ask questions. Once the surrounds have been understood, it is up to the players to describe how they interact with it. If that outcome of interaction has a chance of an unintended outcome or is contested by some other entity then a check is required. If the result of the check is high enough, the outcome is successful. If it is not, the result is not achieved as described. But that does not mean some version of the result does not happen, just that the circumstances change, as directed by the GM. Either result, the GM needs to describe what is around the players once again, usually only mentioning what has changed or been discovered. Then the players describe what they do next and the cycle continues.

#### Dice Rolls
Not every outcome is known in Kaiser, even by the GM. To handle this mysterious outcome, Kaiser primarily uses two six-sided dice to find out what happens. Dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides. When more than one die is needed, a number is placed before the letter d to tell you how many to roll. Sometimes additional numbers are added to the sum of the dice rolled, these are usually noted after the letter d. 

For example, when you see 2d6 + 2. You would roll 2 six-sided dice and add the results of both dice and then add two to get the final result.

The other type of roll that might be needed is a percentile or 1d100. This is done by rolling two d10s, with one designated as the tens place. A roll of two zeros equals a 100. 

#### Types of Checks
In Kaiser, there are five types of checks you will generally make: Difficulty Characteristics Checks, Opposed Characteristics Checks, Difficulty Skill Checks, Opposed Skill Checks, and Resistance Checks. Each one serves a different purpose.

##### Difficulty Characteristics Checks
These checks are made directly against a Characteristic. To make one, roll a d6 and add it to the Characteristic being checked. If the result is greater than or equal to the set Difficulty, you are successful.

##### Opposed Characteristics Checks
Like Difficulty Characteristics Checks, these checks are made using your Characteristics but are opposed by another creature. To make one, roll a d6 and add it to the Characteristic being checked and the opposing creature will do the same. If your result is greater than the opposing result, you are successful.

##### Difficulty Skill Checks 
These are made by rolling 2d6 and adding the results to a Skill. If the result is greater than or equal to the difficulty set by the GM, you are successful.

##### Opposed Skill Checks
Like Difficulty Skill Checks, these are made by rolling 2d6 and adding the results to a Skill, but are opposed by another creature. If your result is greater than the opposing result, you are successful. These checks usually have a "defender" and "attacker" for the purpose of resolving ties.

##### Resistance Checks
Resistance Checks are your capacity to avoid detrimental effects or status. There are five different Resistance Checks: Presence (PrR), Physical (PhR), Immune (IR), Spirit (SR), and Mental (MR). In order to pass a Resistance Check, you roll 2d6 and add the result to the Resistance being tested. If the final value is greater than or equal to the required difficulty, they have avoided the effect. A Resistance Check cannot have an Open Roll or a Fumble.

#### Success
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is greater than the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, the roll is successful. You have 1 Degree of Success for each point above the target difficulty.

#### Tie
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is equal to the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, a tie occurs. If the roll is a Difficulty Check, then the result is still a success and you have 1 Degree of Success (DoS). If it is an Opposed Check, a tie is given to the defender or is handled in a logical way. If no such logical conclusion occurs, have each participant can roll an additional d6 and the higher roll is successful. If the roll is an Attack – a special type of Opposed Skill Check, a tie means the attack fails to connect with the target but the defender is unable to maneuver to make a Counter. 

#### Failure
If the sum of your roll and the relevant bonus is less than the difficulty set by the GM or the opposing creature, the roll is a failure. You have 1 Degree of Failure for each point below the target difficulty.

#### Degree of Success and Failure
Sometimes knowing if a check was successful is enough. However, there are times when it is helpful to know by how much you have succeeded at a given task, or just how badly you failed. This is of particular importance for determining how much damage an attack deals, or if the defender can Counter.

How to determine the Degree of Success or Failure is mentioned in the success and failure section.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage
Some situations have a more or less favorable outcome than normal, either due to environmental conditions or super-natural forces. In these circumstances, your roll is modified to be with Advantage or Disadvantage. Advantage means that when you roll 2d6, roll an additional d6 and take the highest two rolls as your final roll. Disadvantage is you take the lowest two rolls as your final roll. 

In some circumstances, you can have more than one Advantage or Disadvantage. When this occurs, an extra d6 for each level of Advantage or Disadvantage and take the highest or lowest respectively. The level of Advantage is noted as A1, A2, A#; the level of Disadvantage is noted as D1, D2, D#.

If you are affected by both Advantage and Disadvantage, subtract the lowest value from the higher one and that becomes your level of Advantage or Disadvantage.

If you do not have enough dice to roll at once, you can roll the initial 2d6. Then for each level of Advantage, reroll the lowest die. After all the levels of Advantage have been rolled for, or you have rolled double 6 – since that is the highest result possible – you are done. For Disadvantage, reroll the highest of the two dice. After all levels of Disadvantage have been rolled for, or you have rolled double 1 – since that is the lowest result possible – you are done.

For example, if a warrior has two levels of Advantage (A2) from having higher ground and being inspired by a spell but has given him three levels of Disadvantage (D3) from a curse spell, the warrior has one level of Disadvantage (D1) in the end (2 - 3 = -1). So, the warrior will roll three d6s and take the lowest two die as his roll.

#### Open Rolls
This rule is only used when rolling 2d6 for a Skill Check. If the result is a double six, the roller has an Open Roll and can roll another d6 and add the new result to the previous one. If this new d6 also rolls a six, repeat the process.

#### Fumbles
In the same way you can have a great success by means of an Open Roll, the possibility exists that a Fumble occurs. When a 2d6 is rolled for a Skill Check and the result is a double one then you have Fumbled and the result is an immediate failure.

If the roll is for a Difficulty Skill Check, roll another 2d6 to determine the Fumble Level in the table below. The higher the fumble level, the worse the failure. 

Opposed Skill Checks that Fumble have a different effect. Instead you will subtract a value from your Skill. The Final Skill Total cannot be less than 0.

{% include table-index.html title = "Fumble Effect" index = 1 %}
| FUMBLE | RESULT | DIFFICULTY CHECK | OPPOSED CHECK |
|2 TO 5 | The attempt simply does not work. |The die roll is 0. You can still add your skill value. |
| 6 TO 11 | The attempt has a negative effect on the character. | The die roll is a -5. You can still add your skill value. You cannot go below 0. |
| 12+ | The attempt has a disastrous effect on the character. | The die roll is -10. You can still add your skill value. You cannot go below 0. |

#### Mastery
When you have a Final Skill Value greater than 20, you have gained Mastery in that skill. As a result, it is much more difficult for you to make a mistake than it is for a normal person. When you gain Mastery in a skill, Fumbles only occur when three or more ones are rolled as a result of Disadvantage.
