The Exertion group are skills that rely on your physical body.

## Exertion Skills
Below is the description of the Exertion Skills.

### Acrobatics
[@stat Agility @] Characteristic, affected by armor

[@skill Acrobatics @] covers balance, coordination, and mobility. Balancing on a tightrope, walking across ice, staying upright during an earthquake are examples of when an [@skill Acrobatics @] Skill Check would be needed. You can also use [@skill Acrobatics @] to jump and to reduce the amount of damage you receive from falling.

### Athletics
[@stat Constitution @] Characteristic, affected by armor

[@skill Athletics @] covers most forms of physical exertion, such as running, climbing, swimming, and jumping. 

### Feats of Strength
[@stat Strength @] Characteristic, affected by armor

[@skill Feats of Strength @] covers your ability to apply your strength in the greatest way possible. Breaking down a door and holding up a collapsing roof would use [@skill Feats of Strength @] Checks. This skill does not make you actually stronger, just more efficient.

### Ride
[@stat Dexterity @] Characteristic

[@skill Ride @] covers controlling mounted animals and the movement of a vessel. [@skill Ride @] Checks are not needed when simply sitting on a horse and having it walk forward. But complications, such as trying to dodge an arrow while mounted or maneuvering the mount at great speeds, would require a high degree of [@skill Ride @].

## Using Exertion Skills
Below is how to handle using Exertion Skills.

### Reduce Impact
You can make a Very Difficult (20) Degree [@skill Athletics @] or [@skill Acrobatics @] Check to halve the Final Damage -- round down -- from an impact, such as falling or when you are sent flying. For every 4 Degree of Success, the damage is halved again. You can add your Impact AV to this check.

### Running and Sprinting
You lose 1 Stamina Point for every ten minutes of running. You can increase the time by five minutes for every 4 points of Final [@skill Athletics @] Value.

You lose 1 Stamina Point for every round of sprinting. You can increase the time by 1 round for every 4 points of Final [@skill Athletics @] Value.

You can spend 1 Stamina Point to increase your Movement Value based on the result of an [@skill Athletics @] Check. Compare your Final Skill Roll to the table below.

### Swimming
When you are in water, your Movement Value is modified by your result on a [@skill Swim @] Check. The [@skill Swim @] Check is modified by the state of the water. If your Movement Value is reduced to 0, you are unable to stay above the water.

### Jumping
The distance you can jump is determined by your Movement Value. With a running start, requiring about 10 feet of clearance, you can jump a horizontal distance equal to a quarter of your Dash Distance (any distance travelled by jumping is removed from your remaining Movement Distance this round). The vertical distance or horizontal distance without a running start is an eighth of your Dash Distance (or half of your horizontal distance). You can increase your Movement Value for the jump by making an [@skill Athletics @] or [@skill Acrobatics @] Check.

### Climbing
You use the [@skill Athletics @] Skill when you climb up or down any kind of surface. When you climb, your Movement Value is quartered, round down with a minimum of 1. For every 4 Degrees of Success you gain on the [@skill Athletics @] Check, your climbing Movement Value increases by 1 up to your original Movement Value.

Using proper climbing gear gives you a `+4` to the [@skill Athletics @] Check, you also add the Quality Bonus or Penalty of the gear.

### Feats of Strength
By using your strength efficiently, you can use it to greater effect. You can spend 1 Stamina Point to increase your [@stat Strength @] Characteristic based on the result of a [@skill Feats of Strength @] Check. Compare your Final Skill Roll to the table below. This bonus only applies to [@stat Strength @] Characteristic Checks and Breakage Checks. This explicitly does not increase your [@stat Strength @] Modifier or Base Damage.

### Riding
If you are mounted during combat, you must have developed your [@skill Riding @] Skill to do so effectively. While mounted, you use the lower Final Skill Value of your [@skill Ride @] or [@skill Dodge @] Skill when defending with [@skill Dodge @]. A Final [@skill Ride @] Value of less than 4 means you suffer a `-2` penalty to [@skill Strike @] and [@skill Block @] Checks. With 8 or more Final [@skill Ride @] Value, you gain the [@state Higher Ground @] state over any opponent who is not also mounted.

Additionally, while mounted you can add the [@stat Strength @] Modifier of your mount when making a [@action Charging Attack @] with a Pole class weapon. If you have a Final [@skill Ride @] Value of 8, you can add twice the mounts [@stat Strength @] Modifier.
