The Exertion group are skills that rely on your physical body.

## Exertion Skills
Below is the description of the Exertion Skills.

### Acrobatics
Agility Characteristic, affected by armor

Acrobatics covers balance, coordination, and mobility. Balancing on a tightrope, walking across ice, staying upright during an earthquake are examples of when an Acrobatics Skill Check would be needed. You can also use Acrobatics to jump and to reduce the amount of damage you receive from falling.

### Athletics
Constitution Characteristic, affected by armor

Athletics covers most forms of physical exertion, such as running, climbing, swimming, and jumping. 

### Feats of Strength
Strength Characteristic, affected by armor

Feats of Strength covers your ability to apply your strength in the greatest way possible. Breaking down a door and holding up a collapsing roof would use Feats of Strength Checks. This skill does not make you actually stronger, just more efficient.

### Ride
Agility Characteristic

Ride covers controlling mounted animals and the movement of a vessel. Ride Checks are not needed when simply sitting on a horse and having it walk forward. But complications, such as trying to dodge an arrow while mounted or maneuvering the mount at great speeds, would require a high degree of Ride.

## Using Exertion Skills
Below is how to handle using Exertion Skills.

### Running and Sprinting
You lose 1 Stamina Point for every ten minutes of running. You can increase the time by five minutes for every 4 points of Final Athletics Skill.

You lose 1 Stamina Point for every round of sprinting. You can increase the time by 1 round for every 4 points of Final Athletics Skill.

You can increase your Movement Value based on the result of an Athletics Check. Compare your Final Skill Roll to the table below.

### Swimming
When you are in water, your Movement Value is modified by your result on a Swim Check. The Swim Check is modified by the state of the water. If your Movement Value is reduced to 0, you are unable to stay above the water.

### Jumping
The distance you can jump is determined by your Movement Value. With a running start, requiring about 10 feet of clearance, you can jump a horizontal distance equal to a quarter of your Movement Distance (any distance travelled by jumping is removed from your remaining Movement Distance this round). The vertical distance or horizontal without a running start is an eighth of your Movement Distance (or half of your horizontal distance). You can increase your Movement Distance by making an Athletics or Acrobatics Check.

### Climbing
You use the Athletics Skill when you climb up or down any kind of surface. When you climb, your Movement Value is quartered, round down with a minimum of 1. For every 4 Degrees of Success you gain on the Athletics Check, your climbing Movement Value increases by 1 up to your original Movement Value.

Using proper climbing gear gives you a +4 to the Athletics Check, you also add the Quality Bonus or Penalty.

### Riding
If you are mounted during combat, you must have developed your Riding Skill to do so effectively. While mounted, you use the lower Final Skill Value of your Ride or Dodge Skill when defending with Dodge. A Final Ride Value of less than 4 means you suffer a -2 penalty to Strike and Block Checks. With 4 or more Final Ride Value, you gain the Higher Ground State over any opponent who is not also mounted.

Additionally, while mounted you can add the Strength Modifier of your mount when making a Charge Attack with a Pole class weapon. If you have a Final Ride Value of 8, you can add twice the mounts Strength Modifier.
