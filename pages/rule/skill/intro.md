Skills represent your knowledge or talent in performing certain activities and are broken up into two groups called Primary and Secondary. Primary Skills are those used to use powers and take part in combat. The Secondary Skills group contains all other things you might want to train in, like medicine, acrobatics, or stealth.

## Skill Value
The value you have in a skill is the numerical representation of how good you are at things related to that skill. Each skill will have a Final Skill Value which is the sum of the Characteristic Modifier the skill is based on, any innate bonus and natural bonus you possess, and your Base Skill Value. When you make a Skill Check, you add your Final Skill Value to the roll.

Base Skill Value is your bonus based on your time spent training. It is increased by spending Experience equal to a skill's Development Cost. If you have not spent any XP and do not have an innate or natural bonus for a skill, its Base Skill Value is a `-3`.

## Using Skills
When you want to do something, you might have to make a Skill Check to determine if you are successful. 

When you wish to perform an action, the Game Master might ask you for a Skill Check to determine if it occurs. The Game Master must determine what skill you will use and the Degree of Difficulty to assign for a Difficulty Skill Check or who is opposing you for an Opposed Skill Check. Either way, you will roll 2d6 and add the sum of the two dice to the Final Skill Value. This value is called your Base Skill Roll. Your Base Skill Roll is then modified by any other penalties or bonuses you might have, this is called your Final Skill Roll.

For a Difficulty Skill Check, you are successful if your Final Skill Roll is greater than or equal to the Degree of Difficulty. You gain one Degree of Success for each point you have above the Degree of Difficulty, minimum of one. Failure occurs when your Final Skill Roll is less than the Degree of Difficulty. You gain one Degree of Failure (DoF) for each point below the Degree of Difficulty.

Opposed Skill Checks can result in a tie if both you and your opponent gain the same Final Skill Roll. In this situation, the Game Master can either determine that nothing happens or resolve the tie to the benefit of the defender (also determined by the Game Master). If your Final Skill Roll is greater, then you gain one Degree of Success for each point above your opponent's Final Skill Roll. If your opponent's Final Skill Roll is greater, then you gain one Degree of Failure for each point above your Final Skill Roll. Both you and your opponent gain these Degrees of Success and Failure which are opposite numbers.

Your Degrees of Success and Failure, also called Degree of Difference (DoD), can then be used to determine the result of your Skill Check. A Degree of Difference of 1 or more means you were successful or failed with a small margin. A DoD of 4 or more is a great margin, while a DoD of 8 or more is an absolute success or failure.

### Passive Skill Checks
Some skills are used passively, meaning you do not need to declare that you are using them. The Secondary Skill Notice is the most common example. When used passively, the Game Master can ask you to make a roll or can resolve the Skill Check as if you rolled a 6 on the dice. 

## Modifiers to Skills
There are a few different way that a Skill Check can be changed.

### Open Rolls
Open Rolls represent something going unexpectedly well. When you make a Skill Check and roll double six, you have gained an Open Roll. You then roll another 1d6 and add the new result to the previous one. If the new d6 roll is also a six, repeat the process.

When a power increases or decreases the chance of a Open Roll, refer to the table below. If you are affected by more than one increase and or decrease, add all the changes together.

### Fumbles
In the same way you can have a great success by means of an Open Roll, the possibility exists that a Fumble occurs. When you make a Skill Check and roll a double one, you have Fumbled and the result is an immediate failure.

You now roll another 2d6 to determine the Fumble Level from the table below. The higher the fumble level, the worse the failure. Some powers might add or subtract from the Fumble Level.

When a power increases or decreases the chance of a Fumble, refer to the table below. If you are affected by more than one increase and or decrease, add all the changes together.

### Mastery
When you have a Final Skill Value of 20 or more, you have gained Mastery in that skill. As a result, it is much more difficult for you to make a mistake than it is for a normal person. Your Fumble Chance decreases by one when using that skill.

### Knowledge Skills
Skill Checks that are based on academic knowledge might require you to have spent some time studying or have ready access to a source of knowledge. Even with proper academic training, your Final Skill Roll cannot exceed a value that is more than 8 points greater than your current Final Skill Value unless you are near a source of knowledge and spend some time researching. 

If you have not spent time studying and your Base Skill Value is 0, your Final Skill Roll cannot exceed the Easy (4) Degree.

### Specialization
Some skills include broad knowledge or expertise that you can narrow into a single discipline. A skill will list if it can benefit from specialization. In order to gain specialization, you must study and research your area of focus during downtime. You can only have one specialization for the entire Secondary Group. But you can spend more downtime to change your area of specialization.

Once you become specialized, you gain a one degree of Advantage when you make a Skill Check with it. You also count as having 2 more points in the skillâ€™s Final Value for requirements for powers. Lastly, if the skill is also a knowledge skill, your Final Skill Roll cannot exceed a value of 12 points greater than your current Final Skill Value, instead of the usual 8.

### Wearing Armor
When you are wearing armor that you have not had proper training to maneuver in, you gain a deed penalty to certain skills. See the Wear Armor Skill for more details.
