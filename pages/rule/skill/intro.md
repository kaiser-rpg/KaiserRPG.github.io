Skills represent your knowledge or talent in performing certain activities and are broken up into Primary and Secondary groups. Primary Skills are those that allow you to wield weapons or manipulate spirit, mana, or phenom. The Secondary Skills group contains all other things you might want to train in, like medicine, acrobatics, or stealth.

## Using Skills
When you want to do something, you might have to make a Skill Check to determine if you are successful. 

## Skill Value
The measure of your ability with a skill is called your skill value. This is what is added to any Skill Check.

## Mastery
When you have a Skill Value greater than 20, you have gained Mastery in that skill. As a result, it is much more difficult for you to make a mistake than it is for a normal person. When you gain Mastery in a skill, Fumbles only occur when three or more ones are rolled as a result of Disadvantage (lowering the Fumble Chance by 1 degree.
