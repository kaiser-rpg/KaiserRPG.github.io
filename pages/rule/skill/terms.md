**Base Skill Value**: This number is determined by how much Experience you have spent to increase a skill. 

{% include example.html content="Ceil's Base Dodge Skill is a 3 because her Dodge Skill has a Development Cost of 4 and she has invested 12 XP (12/4 = 3)." %}

**Final Skill Value**: This number is the sum of a skill's Base Value, Characteristic Modifier, Natural Bonus/Penalty, and Innate Bonus. Any other modifier to a skill is considered temporary. 

{% include example.html content="Ceil's Final Dodge Skill is a 5 because she has a Base Skill Value of +3, an Agility Modifier of +1, no Natural Bonus and +1 Innate Bonus in Dodge." %}

**Base Skill Roll**: This number is the sum of the Final Skill Value and the roll of a 2d6 using Open Roll and Fumble. States and all other modifiers are added as part of the Final Skill Roll.

{% include example.html content="Ceil's is trying to dodge a bandit's sword swing. She has a Final Dodge Value of 5, rolled an 8 total. So her Base Skill Roll is a 13." %}

**Final Skill Roll**: This number is the sum of the Base Skill Roll and the modifiers of any State or power currently affecting you.

{% include example.html content="Ceil's is trying to dodge a bandit's sword swing. She has a Base Dodge Roll of 13, but her attacker has the Flanked State over her. Since the Flanked State gives her a -3 penalty to her Defensive Rolls, her Final Skill Roll is 10." %}
