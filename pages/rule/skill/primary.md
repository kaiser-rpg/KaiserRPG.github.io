## Initiative
Initiative is a special Primary Skill. Its Base Skill Value is determined by your size, a medium sized creature has a Base Skill Value of 10, and cannot be increased by any means. Each class grants you some Innate Bonus to Initiative.

Your Initiative is used to determine how fast you react. At the beginning of each round of combat, you will make an Initiative Check that is neither a Difficulty or Opposed Skill Check. The Final Skill Roll is used to determine at what order each combatant will act in the round. The Game Master can also ask you to make an Initiative Skill Check outside of combat to determine if you can perform an action before something occurs.
