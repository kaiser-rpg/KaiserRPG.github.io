The Primary Skill Groups contain the skills used to control the three different power sources, Marital, Magic, and Manifest. Additionally, the [@skill Initiative @] Skill is a Primary Skill but follows different rules than all the other skills. How to use each skill is used is found in its section, but a brief description is found below.  

## Initiative
[@stat Dexterity @] and [@stat Agility @] Characteristic, special

[@skill Initiative @] is a special Primary Skill. Its Base Skill Value is determined by your size, a medium-sized creature has a Base Skill Value of 10, and cannot be increased by any means. Each class grants you some Innate Bonus to [@skill Initiative @]. To this you add both your [@stat Dexterity @] and [@stat Agility @] Modifier.

Your [@skill Initiative @] is used to determine how fast you react. At the beginning of each round of combat, you will make an [@skill Initiative @] Check. The Final Skill Roll is used to determine at what order each combatant will act in the round. The Game Master can also ask you to make an [@skill Initiative @] Skill Check outside of combat to determine if you can perform an action before something occurs.

## Martial Group
