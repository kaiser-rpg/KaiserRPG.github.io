title: Action Points
permalink: rule_combat_action_point.html
---

When you wish to perform an action, it might cost you some Actions Points (AP). These Action Points are a representation of your ability to react to each situation as it arises. You start each round with 6 AP and spend them to declare your Intentions and perform actions. You can also lose them when you suffer damage, signifying you have lost some strategic capability that round. At the end of a round, any unspent AP is lost.

## Intentions
Intentions are an action that is declared before rolling Initiative. Things that take a bit of forethought, like preparing a spell or determining what weapons to use.

### Run
**Intention**: 4 AP

The run intention allows you to freely move a given distance based on your Speed. Use the Run distance found for your Speed Value. When you take this Intention, you cannot take the Movement Action or the Sprint Intention.

### Sprint
**Intention**: Complete AP

The sprint intention allows you to freely move a given distance based on your Speed. Use the Sprint distance found for your Speed Value. When you take this Intention, you cannot perform any Active Action or Reaction as you spend your entire round running. You are also unable to take the Movement Action or Run Intention.

### Attack
**Intention**: Weapon Cost + 1 AP

The attack intention allows you to perform the Attack Action once this round. When you take this intention, you must chose one or more weapons that you plan to use this round. The weapon with the worst Initiative Penalty is applied to your Initiative Roll and the highest Weapon Cost is used to determine the AP cost of this Intention. 

With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple Attack Actions each round. For every 10 points you have in your Final Attack Skill, you can perform the Attack Action an additional time. Each additional Attack Action used is harder to aim properly, you suffer a -2 penalty to the Offensive Roll for each Attack Action made after the first. Some powers will grant you additional Attack Actions which may ignore the additional attack penalty.

### Spirit
**Intention**: 1 AP

The spirit intention allows you to manipulate the ki within your spirit. There are two Spirit Intentions and each round you can only take one of them. The two options are Fill Chakra and Transfer Ki.

#### Spirit Intention: Fill Chakra
When you declare this intention, you can fill your Red, Green, and or Blue chakras with ki, from your Ki Reserve, equal to the that chakras value. If you are unable to perform somatic or verbal components, the amount you fill is halved, or quartered if you cannot perform either component. You can also chose to fill none of your chakras. If you take no other Intention or Action this round, you can gain the benefit of your chakra again at the end of the rounds, all modifiers apply.

With ki in your chakras, you can use them to activate any number of spirit abilities or techniques as long as you have the ki to spend. If the ability does not state what chakra to use, you can spend ki from any chakra. At the end of the round that you activate any ki ability or technique, all the remaining ki returns to your Reserve.

If you have ki in your chakra from the previous round and do not take the Fill Chakra Intention again, all your ki returns to your Ki Reserve before rolling Initiative.

#### Sprit Intention: Transfer Ki
When you declare this Intention, as a Swift Action you can push an amount of ki up to the sum of your chakras from your Reserve to that of another. This transference requires you to be in direct contact with the creature or object with a Ki Reserve. You can transfer ki to several different targets as long as the total ki transferred our of your Reserve in a round is less than or equal to the sum of your chakras.

If you are in contact with a Ki Battery, you can instead pull ki from it. Pulling and pushing ki both have a shared maximum per round equal to the sum of your chakras.

### Magic
**Intention**: 2 AP

The magic intention allows you to manipulate mana, whether that be accumulation or transfer. There are four Magic Intentions and each round you can only take one of them. The four options are Accumulate Pure Mana, Accumulate for a Prepared Spell, Transfer Mana, and Cast an Innate Spell.

#### Magic Intention: Accumulate a Mass of Mana
When you declare this Intention, you accumulate mana from your Mana Pool equal to your MA. If you are unable to perform somatic or verbal components, your MA is halved, or quartered if you cannot perform either component. If you take no other Intention or Action this round, you can gain the benefit of your MA again at the end of the round, all modifiers apply.

By accumulating a mass of mana, you have no clear goal for its expense. You simply pull the mana from your Pool into the world until you find a spell that is appropriate for the current situations. This mass of mana can be used to cast any number of spells in a single round as long as you have mana to spend. At the end of the round that you cast any spell with your mass of mana, all the remaining mana returns to your Pool.

If you have a mass of mana from the previous round and do not take the Accumulate a Mass of Mana Intention again, your mass of mana will return to your Pool before rolling Initiative. Due to the stress of the mana returning without a proper outlet, you lose 10 mana from your Pool. Alternatively, you can choose to transform the mass of mana into a prepared spell. See Accumulate for a Prepared Spell for more details.

> Ceil has been Accumulating Pure Mana for four turns. On the start of the fifth turn she has 150 mana available. On her turn she casts Create Light for 20 points, Shield of Light of 50 points, and Induce Calm for 40. The total comes to 110 points, which means she has 40 points remaining. She can use these points to cast another spell or they will return to her pool at the end of the round. Since she had a controlled mana release, she does not lose 10 points. Next round she can start accumulating mana again, starting at zero.

#### Magic Intention: Accumulate for a Prepared Spell
When you declare this Intention, you must also declare a spell and all its options to be prepared for casting. You then accumulate mana from your Mana Pool equal to your MA. If you are unable to perform somatic or verbal components, your MA is halved, or quartered if you cannot perform either component. If you take no other Intention or Action this round, you can gain the benefit of your MA again at the end of the round, all modifiers apply.

Any mana accumulate this way can only be used for the prepared spell. Once the Mana Cost is accumulated, you can cast the spell or you can delay casting the prepared spell for a number of rounds equal to your Focus Characteristic. If you have not cast the prepared spell before the last round that you can delay, the prepared mana returns to your Pool and you lose 10 mana.

While delayed, the prepared mana is not subject to losing concentration from damage and the prepared spell can be cast when you have the appropriate action. Each round you will still have to perform the Maintain Mana Action on your turn since the mana you hold is still unstable. Additionally, you do not have to take the Accumulate for a Prepared Spell Intention with the same spell and options since the spell is already fully prepared. You can declare any other Magic Intention, even starting another Prepared Spell.

If you have prepared mana from the previous round and do not take the Accumulate for a Prepared Spell Intention with the same spell and options, your prepared mana will return to your Pool before rolling Initiative. Due to the stress of the mana returning without a proper outlet, you lose 10 mana from your Pool.

If you have a mass of mana from the previous round, when you declare the Accumulate for a Prepared Spell you can convert that mass of mana into prepared mana. Any excess returns to your Pool. 

#### Magic Intention: Transfer Mana
When you declare this Intention, as a Swift Action you can push an amount of mana up to your Mana Accumulation from your Pool to that of another. This transference requires you to be in direct contact with the creature or object with a Mana Pool. You can transfer mana to several different targets as long as the total mana transferred out of your Pool in a round is less than or equal to your MA.

If you are in contact with a Mana Battery, you can instead pull mana from it. Pulling and pushing mana both have a shared maximum per round equal to your MA.

> For Example, Ceil has an MA of 50. In a single round, she can push 20 mana to Balrog and pull 30 mana from her Mana Battery. She must be in contact with both Balrog and the Mana Battery at some point during the round. But since she took this Intention, she cannot take any other Magic Intentions and thus cannot cast a spell.

#### Magic Intention: Cast an Innate Spell
When you declare this Intention, you gather an amount mana from the environment, called innate mana, in order to cast a spell, called an innate spell. The amount of innate mana you can pull from the environment is determined by your MA, but can also be modified by places with strong or weak ambient mana. You can then cast a single spell whose Mana Cost is no greater than that innate mana. 

Innate mana is very limited in its use due to its raw nature. You are completely unable to accumulate or store it, each round you only have access to what your MA and the environment allow. Even if the amount of innate mana is enough to cast two different spells, only one can be cast. Innate mana cannot be absorbed into your Pool or a Mana Battery â€” that is what your Mana Recovery is for. You are able to maintain an innate spell, but while doing so you cannot cast another innate spell since the innate mana is already being used.

{% include table-index.html index="MAGIC40" %}

### Phenom
**Intention**: 3 AP

The phenom intention allows you to manipulate the energies of reality to manifest phenoms. There are two Phenom Intention and each round you can only take one of them. The two options are Manifest Phenom and Concentrate on Manifesting.

#### Phenom Intention: Manifest Phenom
When you declare this intention, you can manifest one or more phenom this round. In order to manifest a chosen phenom, you make a Difficulty Check using your Phenom Potential with the proper action. Then compare the final roll to the phenoms degrees. You manifest the highest degree that you have mastered and your roll matches or beats.

If you wish to manifest more than one phenom in a round, you can chose to hold back some of your natural Potential, effectively splitting it between phenom. You must use at least one point for each phenom you manifest. 

> For example, Sarah wishes to manifest two Immolation phenoms this round with her Phenom Potential of 5. She choses to split her potential to manifest one Immolation with 2 and a the other with 3 Phenom Potential. Since she has a +2 to her Potential Roll to manifest Immolation (due to permanent PP spending), the final number added to the roll is 4 and 5.

### Stance
**Intention**: 0 AP

The stance intention allows you to prepare yourself for certain circumstances in combat. You can only take one stance each round. Some of the stances also give you an Initiative Penalty.

#### Absorbing Hits

#### Anticipate Surprise

#### Defensive Fan

#### Total Defense

#### Total Attack


## Active Actions

### Attack
**Active**: 0 AP

TODO

With sufficient skill, you can perform multiple Attack Rolls in a round. But each additional attack is harder to perform, suffering from a cumulative -2 penalty for each additional attack after the first. This penalty has no limit.

Remember, any Attack Action counts for the purpose of this penalty accumulating, unless specifically stated otherwise. Some powers allow you suspend this penalty as well.

{% include table-index.html index="" %}

{% include example.html content="TODO" %}


### Off-hand Attack
**Active**: 0 AP

### Move
**Active**: 3 AP

Once you take this action, you can move a distance up to what your Movement Value allows. This movement can be used at any point during your turn, even if you delay or take other actions between moving. You can only take this action once per round. If you become effected by a power that increases or decreases your Movement Value, it can increase or decrease your remaining movement.

{% include example.html content="Ceil takes the Move action and can now move up to 35 feet. Since movement can be broken up, she could move 10 feet, cast a spell, move 15 feet, attack with her long sword, move 10 feet, and finally cast another spell." %}

{% include example.html content="Ceil takes the Move action and can now move up to 35 feet. After using all her movement, she is affected by a power that increases her Movement Value by 2 points, granting her an additional 10 feet of movement. As long as she has AP remaining, she can take her turn again and use that extra movement." %}

### Aim
**Active**: 3 AP

You take your time to line up your next projectile, gaining one level of Advantage each round you do so. Aiming at a target requires keeping it in view all the time. If you lose sight of your target even for a second, you may not apply the bonuses and must aim at your target again to reacquire the bonuses. Aiming for more than 3 rounds does not increase the Advantage any more. This action can only be taken once per round and not on the same round that you perform an Attack Action.

### Reload
**Active**: 1 AP

You prepare a ranged weapon you have at the ready for another attack. This action covers grabbing a piece of ammunition, loading it, and preparing the firing mechanism. Once you have performed a number of Reload Actions on a Fired Weapon, it is ready and can be used to make an attack.

For each 10 points of Attack Skill and Sleight of Hand Skill, you can reduce the Reload Time for your weapon by one round. If you reduce the Reload Time to less than 1, you can reload the weapon as part of an Attack Roll and do not need to perform the Reload Action with that weapon.

### Maintain Spirit
**Active**: 1 AP

You maintain your focus on your Ki. If you are maintaining any spirit abilities or techniques, and have not taken this action before the End Phase, all of your maintained spirit abilities and techniques end.

Minor and greater sustained techniques do not require you to take this action.

### Maintain Spell
**Active**: 1 AP

You keep your focus on your maintained spells. If you are maintaining any non-daily spells, and have not taken this action before the End Phase, all of your non-daily maintained spells end.

### Maintain Phenom
**Active**: 1 AP

You maintain your focus on your phenoms. If you are maintaining any phenom, and have not taken this action before the End Phase, you lose all maintained phenom.

### Use an Active Power
**Active**: 0+ AP

You use a power that has an Active Action requirement. 

### Use an Item
**Active**: 0+ AP

You use an item, this can include activating an artifact, drinking a potion, or pulling a lever. Many items directly list the AP cost to use them, otherwise the GM will determine the cost.

## Reactions

### Counter
**Reaction**: 1 AP

This action can be taken after an opponent has failed an attack against you. This allows you to use the Attack Action without it being your turn. You must be able to perform a counterattack against the opponent who failed the attack and have Attack Actions remaining this round. This attack is made before the opponent can perform any other actions or attacks. If you gained a Counter Bonus, donâ€™t forget to add it to the Offensive Roll. The Attack Action cannot be used to perform any maneuvers.

You cannot counterattack a ranged attack unless the attacker was within hand-to-hand range or you have a power that specifically lets you counterattack at range.

### Use a Reaction Power
**Reaction**: 0+ AP

You use a power that has a Reaction requirement. 

## Swift Actions

### Defend with Block or Dodge
**Swift**: 0 AP

When you are subject to an attack, you can take this Action. You use your Block or Dodge Skill to prevent damage. You suffer a penalty for using this action multiple times in a round. For complete details, see the Attacking and Defense section in this chapter.

If you are subject multiple attacks in a single turn, each successive attack is harder to block or dodge. For that reason, you suffer a -2 for each attack after the first when using this Action. This penalty cannot exceed -10 (6 attacks).

{% include table-index.html index = "" %}


### Defend with a Power
**Swift**: 0 AP

When you are subject to an attack, have the ability to use a defensive power, you can take this Action. The power will list what skill to use and how to resolve the Defensive Roll. 

The most common way to defend with a power is to use a supernatural barrier produced from a spell or phenom. In this case, you will use your Magic Projection or Psychic Projection Skill respectively. The complete rules for supernatural barriers can be found [here](rule_combat_powers.html#supernatural-barriers).

### Use a Swift Power
**Active**: 0+ AP

You use a power that has a Swift Action requirement. 

### Speak
**Swift**: 0 AP

You can speak to those nearby you. Remember that each round only lasts 6 seconds.

## Secondary Skills

### Withdraw (Acrobatics)
**Special**: 1 AP, part of moving

You attempt to withdraw from hand-to-hand combat, even against several adversaries at once â€“ by jumping over one of them or by tumbling past them. To do this, you must have the ability to act, either because it is your turn, or because you have earned the right to make a counterattack. In such a moment, you perform an Opposed Skill Check using your Acrobatics Skill against the Attack Skill of one opponent within hand-to-hand weapon range. You can add any Counterattack bonus you have against the opponent. If you gain 4 DoS, you have succeeded in fleeing from the hand-to-hand combat without permitting that opponent to carry out any attacks against you. With less than 4 DoS, your opponent has intercepted your escape, and you will suffer attacks normally. If you fail, your opponent gains the ability to make a Counter against you, gaining their DoS as a Counter Bonus.

This action only has to be taken once each round, but the Opposed Skill Check must be made for every opponent you leave hand-to-hand combat range of. An opponent with no Attack Actions remaining cannot roll; an opponent can choose to not roll.

### Slip Away (Stealth)
**Special**: 1 AP, part of moving

### Use a Skill

## Maneuvers

### Gain the Upper Hand
**Attack**: 1 AP

By using Acrobatics, you can maneuver yourself to flank or get behind your opponent, which giving you a considerable tactical advantage in combat. You attempt this right before making an Attack Roll. To do so, you perform an Opposed Skill Check with your Acrobatics Skill against either the Attack or Acrobatics Skill of your opponent. This maneuver occurs in one motion together with an attack.

With less than 10 DoS, you are unable to maneuver into position but you do not leave yourself open to being hit and the attack can proceed as normal. If you win the Opposed Check with 10 DoS, you have placed yourself on your enemyâ€™s flank and can then attack. With 15 DoS or more, you have maneuvered behind them and can then attack. If the maneuver fails, the defender has prevented your maneuvering and you lose the ability to perform the Attack Action and can thereafter Counter, gaining the full DoF as a bonus. If you have the ability to make multiple Attack Actions each round, you only lose the ability to make the Attack Action used to perform this maneuver.

Each time you use this maneuver against a target, they gain a +1 to defend against it until a week has passed since the last time you used the maneuver against them.

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks.

### Directed Attack
**Attack**: 1 AP

You try to strike a specific part of our opponentâ€™s body â€“ applying the appropriate penalty to your Offensive Roll as indicated in the following table. Of course, it is impossible to include all possible penalties for body parts of creatures that may physically be very different from humans; any necessary adjustments should be made by the GM as appropriate to the circumstances. It is unnecessary to determine the body part that a Critical hit lands.

Usable with any kind of Offensive Roll that does not hit an area. This includes spells and phenom.

{% include table-index.html index="" %}

### Disable
**Attack**: 1 AP

This maneuver disables an opponent without killing them, perhaps by breaking their arm or leg, or cutting their tendons. You make an Offensive Roll against an opponentâ€™s arm or leg â€“ using the penalties found in the Direct Attack Table â€“ but declare that you only wish to disable your opponent, the Final Damage of the attack is reduced by half. However, the GM should calculate the damage fully for determining the Critical level. The designated arm or leg is considered a vulnerable point when calculating the damage necessary to create a Critical. Disable does not work against creatures with Damage Resistance.

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks. Some powers will allow you to perform this maneuver as part of the ability.

### Knock Out
**Attack**: 1 AP

You try to knock an opponent out instead of actually killing them. For this purpose, you must make an Offensive Roll against your opponentâ€™s head â€“ using the penalties found in the Direct Attack Table. You must declare your intention to Knock Out an opponent before rolling the dice. Knock Out attempts produce only half the normal damage, but the GM should consider the full damage for calculating the Critical level. If the Critical level is higher than 5, the wounded combatant is automatically Knocked Out. When you use this maneuver, a Critical cannot cause negative effects beyond those of being Knocked Out, losing AP, or inflicting Action Penalties. It can never cause automatic death. 

If you attempt to Knock Out an opponent using something other than an Impact weapon, you suffer an additional penalty of -4 to your Attack Roll. 

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks. Some powers will allow you to perform this maneuver as part of the ability.

### Put at Weapon's Point
**Attack**: 1 AP

This special purpose attack is an attempt to "get the drop" on an adversary by putting a weapon in a position where it could easily kill them (for instance, a knife at their throat or the point of a sword resting on their chest), but not cause them damage. When you attempt this maneuver, you suffer a -10 penalty on your Offensive Roll, the defender's armor does count, since it reduces the number of vulnerable places that can be threatened. If you obtain at least 1 DoS, the defender is instead Put at Weaponâ€™s Point, with no loss of Life Points.

Unlike in any other situation, once you place an opponent At Weaponâ€™s Point you can thereafter attack that opponent as a Swift Action, as long as you have Attack Actions â€“ unless someone, even the affected opponent, obtains Surprise on you.

If the GM permits, it is possible for you to declare you will try Put at Weaponâ€™s Point on an opponent even after you have thrown the dice for your attack â€“ as long as the defender has not yet thrown their dice.

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks.

### Take Down
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you attempt this maneuver, you suffer a -3 penalty to your Offensive Roll. The penalty increases to -6 if you are wielding a weapon without the Take Down property. A Take Down maneuver does not cause the defender to take any damage.

If you gain at least 1 DoS with the attack, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. You can choose either Strength or Dexterity, while the Defender must choose between Strength or Agility. If you gain at least 1 DoS in the Opposed Characteristic Check, your opponent immediately falls to the ground.

If you gained less than 10 DoS in the Offensive Roll, you suffer a -3 penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained 20 or more DoS, you gain a +3 to the Opposed Characteristic Check. 

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks. Some powers will allow you to perform this maneuver as part of the ability.

### Disarm
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you attempt this maneuver, you suffer a -4 penalty to your Offensive Roll. A Disarm maneuver does not cause the defender to take any damage.

If you gain at least 1 DoS with the attack, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. You can choose either Strength or Dexterity, while the defender must choose between Strength or Agility. If you gain at least 1 DoS in the Opposed Characteristic Check, your opponent is disarmed.

If you gained less than 10 DoS in the Offensive Roll, you suffer a -3 penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained 20 or more DoS, you gain a +3 to the Opposed Characteristic Check. 

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks. Some powers will allow you to perform this maneuver as part of the ability.

### Trap
**Attack**: 1 AP

When you attempt this maneuver, you suffer a -4 penalty to your Attack Roll. A Trapping maneuver does not cause the Defender to take any damage.

If you gain at least 1 DoS with the attack, then you and the defender perform an Opposed Characteristic Check. You can choose either Strength or Dexterity, while the defender must choose between Strength or Agility. See the below table for the result of the Trapping.

{% include table-index.html index="" %}

If you gained less than 10 DoS in the Offensive Roll, you suffer a -3 penalty to the Opposed Characteristic Check. If you gained 20 or more DoS, you gain a +3 to the Opposed Characteristic Check.

In order to free themselves, a Partially or Mostly Restrained opponent can attempt a new Opposed Characteristic Check for 2 AP on their turn â€“ although all such attempts suffer a -3 penalty to the Characteristic used. If for some reason the Trapped person cannot perform any action that round â€“ does not get a chance to roll Initiative, they can still attempt to free themselves at the end of the turn, after all other combatants have acted.

When you keep someone contained with a Trap, you are unable to move freely, therefore applying a Partially Restrained penalty to all of your actions. Every attack you make permits the person being held to try to free themselves from the hold, even if it is Fully Restrained.

Each round, you must spend 2 AP on your turn to maintain the Trap.

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks. Some powers will allow you to perform this maneuver as part of the ability.

Once you have an opponent trapped, there are various possibilities beyond simply keeping them immobile.

#### Full Attack
**Attack**: 0 AP

Once you have your opponent trapped, you can opt to make an Attack Roll with your full skill (that is to say, without the penalty from being Partially Restrained) if, when completing the hit, you immediately release your trapped opponent. This is due to you taking advantage of the trap so as to hit the victim, but without restricting your own movement by maintaining the hold.

This maneuver can be interpreted many ways, depending on the style of combat of the character; it could mean that the fighter throws its opponent against the ground, performs a wrestling move, or executes any other move that the GM and player deem appropriate in this situation.

#### Crush
**Intention**: Complete AP

If you have been able to make your adversary submit to a Mostly or Total Restrained with a Trap Attack unarmed, you can attempt to use physical force to crush your adversary. In such a situation, you can spend your turn to crush the body of your victim, this uses up all your AP. You must not have taken any Action or rolls other than to maintain the Trap or Defend yourself.

Carrying out this maneuver does not require an Offensive Roll (remember that the subject is already held), but rather is carried out by making an Opposed Strength Check. Every point of Impact AV defender possesses can add a +1 to their check. The target being crushed automatically takes 5 damage for each DoF. If the DoF is greater than 5, the damage is increased to 10 per point.

This check is different than the one made by a held individual in order to free themselves; nothing stops the opponent being crushed from trying to escape when it is their turn during the round.

Remember that it is not possible to use this maneuver with Partially Restrained, given that you do not have your opponent sufficiently held so as to be able to carry it out correctly.

Naturally, logic dictates that not all creatures are susceptible to being damaged by this maneuver; it would not seem plausible to think that a water elemental, made up only of liquids, can be crushed by conventional means.

#### Strangulations
**Attack**: +0 AP
Once Restrained, be that in a Partially, Mostly, or Fully fashion, you can attempt to strangle your victim if you are able to grab it by the neck. In this case, you and your opponent must make a contested Characteristic Check, where you use Strength and the defender can opt to use their Constitution or Strength.

Should you win the check, the opponent will begin to suffer the effects of lack of air, and must make a Physical Resistance Check every round in accordance with the lack of air rules.

### Secondary Damage Type
**Attack**: 0 AP

All normal weapons make an attack of a certain type â€“ Cutting, Impact, or Thrust â€“ depending on the weapon's nature. Although most weapons use only one of those damage types, some weapons also have a Secondary Damage Type that you can use in combat. You can use a Two-handed Sword, for example, as an Impact weapon (due to its great weight and hardness), in spite of the fact that it is intended as a Cutting weapon. If a weapon has a possible Secondary Damage Type, you can use it instead of the Primary Damage Type, applying a -1 to your Offensive Roll when doing so.

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks.

### Sweeping Attack
**Attack**: 2 AP

This kind of special attack allows you to try and hit several opponents with a single attack. Due to its difficulty, performing this maneuver causes a -5 penalty to your Offensive Roll. All of the targeted individuals in the specified area must defend against an attack at the same Final Offensive Roll, according to the order in which they are situated. In order for you to utilize a Sweeping Attack, your targets must all be close to one another and within reach of the weapon. If you have taken the Movement Action and still have some movement left, you can move up to a tenth of your maximum movement during the Sweeping Attack to select valid targets.

The maximum number of targets for a Sweeping Attack depends exclusively on the size of the weapon used. Small and Medium weapons can reach only three and four opponents, respectively, while Large weapons can attack up to five. These figures are for human-sized opponents; the Game Master can adjust the number upward or downward as appropriate for opponents of other sizes.

If one of the defenders obtains the right to Counter using Block, that defender manages to halt the Sweeping Attack. Those who have not yet defended themselves are not subject to the attack at all.

If a defender obtains the right to Counter by using Dodge, the Sweeping Attack continues on its path; the defender must wait until the attack finishes before making their Counterattack. 

Only usable with hand-to-hand attacks.

### Sneak Attack
**Intention**: Complete AP

### Multiple Missiles
**Attack**: 1 AP

Although it makes your precision slightly worse, you have the capacity to launch several projectiles simultaneously to increase the destructive power of your attacks. An example of this maneuver in use would be someone nocking two or three arrows in their bow or hurling a fistful of daggers with a single hand. By using this maneuver, you have the capacity to shoot or throw more than one projectile in a single attack, increasing your Base Damage by +1 for each additional projectile up to a maximum of +3 (that is to say, launching up to four projectiles total). However, using this maneuver reduces your precision, requiring you to apply a penalty of -1 to your Offensive Roll for each additional projectile that you launch.

It must be kept in mind that, being a single attack, this maneuver does not use the normal rules for Rate of Fire and Reload Projectile Weapons. In addition, certain Ranged Weapons, like crossbows, pistols, or muskets, cannot be used in this way due to their nature.

Only usable with ranged attacks.
