Action Points are a representation of your ability to react to each situation as it arises. You start each round with 6 AP and spend them to declare your Intentions and perform actions. You can also lose them when you suffer damage, signifying you have lost some strategic advantage or part of your attention that round. At the end of a round, any unspent AP is lost.

## Spending Action Points
Some actions require you to spend AP when you perform them. If you are unable to meet the cost, you cannot perform that action.


## Losing Action Points
When you take damage, you lose a point of AP. 

### Flat-footed
Flat-footed occurs when you would lose an Action Point from taking damage and how none to lose. Once you become flat-footed, you cannot take any more active actions or reactions that round and cannot use any unspent movement. You can still perform Swift Actions.
