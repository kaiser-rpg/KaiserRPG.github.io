Action Points are a representation of your ability to react to each situation as it arises. You start the Intention Phase with 6 AP. At the End Phase, any unused AP is lost.

## Spending Action Points
Many actions require you to spend AP to perform. If you do not have enough AP remaining, you cannot perform the action. There are two types of AP cost. 

The first is a numerical value listed with the Action Type. So an action that is "Active: 1 AP" requires it to be your turn and spend 1 AP before you can perform it. If the AP cost is zero, then you can perform it as long as you are not [@state Flat-Footed @].

The second type of cost is called Complete AP. Like numerical, it will appear after the Action Type, "Intention: Complete AP." These require you to have spent no AP this turn and all of it will be used by the action. These actions are all consuming and leave little other options for your turn. Since it consumes all your AP, you naturally cannot take any action with an AP cost greater than 0.


## Losing Action Points
In addition to spend AP, you can lose it when something distracts you, splitting your attention. The most common example of this is when you are subject to an attack. If you fail to defend yourself, you gain one or more Degrees of Failure on a Defensive Roll, you lose 1 AP. This lose of AP occurs with each successful hit, even if the attack ends up dealing no damage.

### Flat-Footed
When you have no remaining AP and are subject to a forced AP lose, like when hit by an attack, you gain the [@state Flat-Footed @] State. This means you cannot take any Active Actions or Reactions, even if their AP cost is 0, and you lose any remaining Movement Distance.
