The most common type of defense power is one that employs a supernatural barrier. This barrier is used to block incoming attacks, in much the same manner as using the Block Skill, but it has a few key differences.

### Defending with a Barrier
The first thing to remember about barriers is that they are not a complete shield against attacks. You must use a Defensive Skill, the exact skill will depend on the power, to maneuver the barrier in front of the attack. Failure to do so will cause the attacker to get past your barrier and strike you. This works exactly like a Defensive Roll, so the Degree of Success that the attacker gains and your AV and Absorption are used to calculate how much damage you take.

When you do successfully block with a barrier, the barrier will absorb the attack and take damage equal to the Base Damage of the Attack times ten. Each power will list how many Life Points a barrier can take before breaking.

### Barrier Break
When an attack reduces a barrier's Life Points to zero, it breaks. Then whoever is protected by the barrier automatically suffer any damage not absorbed by the barrier. You can reduce the damage by 1 point for each AV against that Damage Type. Both types of Damage Negate and Damage Resistance will only reduce the Final Damage taken.

### Barriers and other Defenses
You can only rely on one method of defense against any single attack. If you defend yourself by Dodging an attack, then a barrier trying to block will only get in the way and vice versa. If a barrier is unable to block an attack, you are not able to then Block or Dodge as there is not enough time to react. Similarly, if you are covered by multiple barriers, you can only use one of them to block since they would get in each other’s way.

### Covering Others with Barriers
A barrier can be used to cover someone other than its creator, but due to the complexity to creating and controlling a barrier at a distance some special rules apply.

First, a barrier used to protect someone else must have been created as an Active Action, instead of a Swift Action as part of the Defense, before the target is attacked.

Second, you are the one who makes the Defensive Rolls for the target and suffer two degrees of Disadvantage. If the target moves past the effective range of your powers, the Disadvantage increases to four degrees. Beyond the maximum range of your powers you are unable to protect the target. If you are subject to a State that modifies your Defensive Roll, it also applies when making Defensive Rolls for the target. If the target is subject to a Situation that modifies their Defensive Roll, it applies when making Defensive Rolls for the target.

Third, like when you defend yourself with a barrier, the target must choose whether to rely on your barrier or their own Defensive Skills when attacked. 

> For example, Ceil has cast Shield of Light on Thom. Thom has become Fully Restrained as a result of a Trapping Maneuver by a bandit. When another bandit tries to attack Thom, he can choose to defend with his Dodge Skill (which has a -20 penalty due to the Fully Restrained State) or rely on Ciel’s Magic Projection (which has a D2 due to covering others). Thom choses the barrier. Later in the combat, Ceil also becomes Fully Restrained, and the -20 penalty then also applies when Thom relies on the barrier for defense.

#### Covering an Area
Instead of covering a single target, you can expand a barrier to protect multiple creatures. Like with covering a single creature other than yourself, some additional rules apply.

First, a barrier used to protect an area can be created using a Swift Action as part of the Defense as long as you are one of the covered creatures. If you are not, you must use a barrier that you had created before the attack.

Second, you are the one who makes a single Defensive Roll for all creatures under your barrier and you suffer two degrees of Disadvantage. You can cover a circular area whose radius is equal to your Focus Characteristic in feet. The barrier takes damage for each creature protected. If a barrier breaks, divide the remaining damage evenly among the protected creatures.

Third, like when you defend yourself with a barrier, each protected creature can choose whether to rely on your barrier or their own Defensive Skills when attacked.

## Power Collision
It is possible for two powers or supernaturally charged objects to collide with one another. The results of the collision will depend on the strength of the colliding projectiles. To create a collision, you must meet three criteria: you have to take the Collide Power Reaction, be in a position and have the ability to make a parallel shot, and have an Initiative within 5 points of the opponent that launched the original projectile, or surpass their Initiative. Then you use a ranged attack power (or shoot a supernaturally charged projectile as a Reaction) at the opposing Power. You make an Offensive Roll and the result must be within 5 points of the opposing roll, or surpass it. If you achieve this result, then both you and the opponent roll 2d6 and add the Base Damage of the Power. The Degree of Difference (DoD) is compared to the below table.

It is possible to have two or more powers combine during a collision. The value added to the Collision roll is the highest Base Damage of the combined Powers, and then half the second greatest, and a third of the third greatest, and so on.
