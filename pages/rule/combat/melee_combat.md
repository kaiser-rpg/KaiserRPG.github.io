{% include table-index.html table="state" index="400" %}

### Higher Ground
When you are positioned above your opponent, such as being mounted or standing on a table, you gain one degree of Advantage on the Offensive Roll.

### Drawing a Weapon
If you do not have your weapon drawn and at the ready before the Intention Phase, you apply one degree of Disadvantage on your Offensive Roll and Defensive Roll when Blocking. This modifier can also be applied if you switch weapons in of the Action Phase.

### Smaller Opponent
If your opponent is half your size, you apply one degree of Disadvantage on the Offensive Roll. Similarly, an opponent one-tenth your size or smaller would cause you to apply two degrees of Disadvantage. This does not apply for Area Attacks.

## Unarmed Block
Without a proper weapon to block with, you can resort to using your bare hands. But, doing do means you are subject to the Breakage of the weapon. Your Fortitude is equal to your Constitution or Dexterity Characteristics but can be modified by any power as if it were a weapon. For each Degree of Success the attack gains on the Breakage Check, you suffer 5 points of damage. Once you gain Mastery with Unarmed Blocking, you can ignore this check as you are able to stop the sharpest of weapons without harming yourself.
