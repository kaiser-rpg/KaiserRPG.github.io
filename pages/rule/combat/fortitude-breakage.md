When your attack is blocked or collides with an object, there is a chance that the defending object breaks. A Breakage Check is used to determine if the defending object is damaged by the collision. weapons, and some powers, have a special Characteristic called Breakage and all objects have a Fortitude Characteristic. A Breakage Check is an Opposed Characteristic Check using the weapon's Breakage against the defending object's Fortitude. If you gain one or more Degrees of Success, the defending object reduces it's quality by 1 point. If this would reduce it's quality to a negative value, the Game Master will determine if it becomes useless. 

A Breakage Check should not occur on every collision. When you perform the Sunder maneuver, a Breakage Check always occurs. If your Offensive Roll gains at least ten Degrees of Success -- this indicates a direct hit -- you can choose wether or not you will try to break the target's armor, or zir weapon if ze tried to blocked with it. Naturally, a Breakage Check can only be performed if the weapon or power has a Breakage value.

If your weapon is subject to a Breakage Check, you can attempt to break the attacking weapon. Instead of using your weapons Fortitude, you use it's Breakage but you do not add your Strength Modifier. Then, whichever weapon has the lower Final Roll Value breaks.

The general rule for fully breaking objects is as follows. Weapons break when their Weapon Damage is reduced to zero. Armor breaks when all AVs are reduced to zero.

The Breakage and Fortitude of each object is listed in it's profile.
