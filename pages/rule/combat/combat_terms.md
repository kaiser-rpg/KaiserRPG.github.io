Below is the description for a few terms you will find repeated in this chapter.

#### Offensive Skill
An Offensive Skill is the skill you use to aim your attack and break through your opponents defense. There are three skills that you can use Offensively: Attack, Magic Projection, Psychic Projection. 

#### Offensive Roll 
This value is the sum of the Offensive Skill you are using to attack, the result of a 2d6 roll, and any modifiers. Since this roll is made as part of an Opposed Skill Check, the 2d6 roll is subject to Fumbles and Open Rolls. The Offensive Roll is opposed by a Defensive Roll.

#### Defensive Skill 
A Defensive Skill is what you use to avoid your opponents attack. There are four skills you can use Defensively: Block, Dodge, Magic Projection, Psychic Projection.

#### Defensive Roll
This value is the sum of the Defensive Skill you are using to defend, the result of a 2d6 roll, and any modifiers. Since this roll is made as part of an Opposed Skill Check, the 2d6 roll is subject to Fumbles and Open Rolls. The Defensive Roll is opposed by an Offensive Roll.

#### Absorption
This is your innate ability to resist attacks. Most creatures have an Absorption of two. This value is automatically subtracted from any Degree of Failure you obtain while defending yourself.

#### Damage Type 
This is the means by which the incoming attack will harm you. There are twelve types, which are divided into four groups: Physical, Elemental, Energy, Resistance. Each Damage Type will be discussed in a later section.

#### Armor Value 
Armor Value (AV) is your protection against a certain Damage Type. Like Damage Type, AV has twelve types divided into four groups: Physical, Elemental, Energy, Resistance.

The AV that corresponds to the Damage Type of an attack is automatically subtracted from any Degree of Failure you obtain while defending yourself. In addition, some Resistance Checks also let you add a certain AV to your roll.

#### Base Damage 
This is amount of damage an attack will do for each Unit of Damage. This value is always greater than zero.

#### Units of Damage 
The Units of Damage represents how well the attack found its mark. The defender takes the Base Damage of the attack for each Unit of Damage. Or in simpler terms, Base Damage multiplied by the Units of Damage. The Units of Damage is found by taking the Degrees of Success of the attack and subtracting the defenders Absorption and Armor Value. This value cannot be less than zero.

Zero Units of Damage indicates that the attack landed but the defender was able to absorb the blow, due to having enough Armor Value and Absorption.
