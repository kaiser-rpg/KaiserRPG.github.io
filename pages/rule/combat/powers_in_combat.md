In Kaiser, there are many different abilities and features that grant you special powers. Powers can come from many different sources, such as spirit, mana, and phenom, but they share many similar rules. These rules are described below.

## Types of Powers
Below are the types of powers that you can find in Kaiser. The description of each type of power includes how to use your Offensive or Defensive Skills and the visibility of the power.

### Attack
Powers of this type allow you to perform an Offensive Roll against a target using the appropriate Offensive Skill. This power is equivalent to a thrown projectile attack; the Base Damage is determined by the power and the Maximum Distance is based on your Offensive Skill or is directly listed. 

Attack powers can be seen on the material plane. The power will list if it can only be blocked with immaterial objects or if the power can hit immaterial creatures.

Additional details on how to make an attack with a power, see LINKTO.

### Defense
Defense powers allow you to use an appropriate Defensive Skill to prevent certain attacks, depending on the what the Power allows. Most Defense powers create a supernatural barrier. Powers that do not create supernatural barriers will list how to defend with them.

Defense powers are visible on the material plane. The power will list if it can block an immaterial object.

Additional details on how to defend with a Supernatural Barrier, see LINKTO.

### Effect
Powers of this type target an aspect of a creature. You use an appropriate Offensive Skill to aim and strike the target. The target applies their Absorption and AV — usually Force. If you obtain at least one Unit of Damage, then you cause the target to make a Resistance Check listed by the power. Gaining additional Units of Damage have no effect on the Resistance Check.

Effect powers never deal damage from the Offensive Roll — unless the power is also of the Attack Type — but it can hit immaterial targets if it uses the Force Damage Type. Additional, if the defender is unable to touch immaterial objects, they are unable to block Effect Powers unless otherwise stated.

Effect Powers are equivalent to a thrown projectile but they cannot be seen on the material plane. Instead, the power will list what vision is required to not apply the Blind Penalty to defend. Powers that belong to both Attack and Effect are visible on the material plane. 

### Automatic
Powers of this type produce automatic effects on you, another creature, or the environment. They usually produce beneficial effects. The maximum distance will be listed or is determined by an appropriate Offensive Skill and you do not require an Offensive Roll unless the target is in a difficult position. If no Resistance Check Difficulty is listed, the target can resist with a SR 8 Check. 

Automatic Powers are not visible on the material plane. But the after-effect can be material, like shedding light or healing wounds.

### Trigger
Powers of this type have certain triggering conditions and do not require Offensive Skills for range or aim. Any target who meets the conditions automatically suffer the effects of the power. 

Trigger powers are frequently Effect as well, in this case the target makes the Resistance Check when the triggering condition is meet. A target who passes the Resistance Check is immune to the Power's Resistance Check for a number of rounds equal to their Degree of Success. Once the immunity ends and the conditions are meet again, the target must make another Resistance Check.

Some Trigger powers can have a center point other than you. The center can be placed anywhere within range of your Offensive Skill. You may require an Offensive Roll if the target is in a difficult position.

### Detection
Powers of this type are a special type of Trigger power. The Trigger is just being within range and it allows you to gain information, whether that be location, condition, or characteristics, of any target that fails the Resistance Check. Detection powers can be negated by some powers and a target gets a bonus to the Resistance Check based on their Conceal Ki skill if they have developed it.

## Common Power Features
Many powers share similar features. Below are some general rules that are described below to either clarify or provide some further detail.

### Immaterial
Ghosts, spirits, and other creatures that do not fully exist on the material plane have a trait called immaterial. This trait gives them the ability to ignore material objects like weapons, armor, and shields; this can make them difficult or impossible to fight.

In order to hit a creature with the immaterial trait, your attack have the imbued trait, meaning it is imbued with energy capable of interacting with an immaterial creature. All attacks that deal damage from the Energy Group naturally have the imbued trait. For Physical and Elemental damage, you need to gain the imbued trait from some other feature, ability, or power. Whether a Resistance power, dealing damage from the Resistance Group, is imbued will be listed in the power’s description.

Similarly, a creature with the immaterial trait will make its attacks immaterial as well. To defend against such an attack, you must either dodge or block it with an imbued object.

The spirit abilities of Presence Extrusion and Aura Extension allow you to grant the imbued trait to your weapons. The meta magic ability Imbued Spell allows your attack and defense spells to gain the imbued trait. A phenom will list at what degree it gains the imbued trait. Some artifacts can also give you or your powers the imbued trait.

### Area Attack

### Affected Presence
All objects and creatures have a certain amount of essence in the world, measured by their presence. Some powers are only able to affect a certain sum of presence. In these cases, the sum of the affected presence must be equal to or less than the listed presence. 

In general, the presence of equipment, cloths, and even most artifacts do not need to be included when determining affected presence as long as it is on the target's person.

For example, if you were to cast the spell Invisibility at the Base Degree you can affect a maximum of 10 presence. So, you can target three creatures with 3 presence each, two creatures with 5 presence each, or one creature with 6 presence and another with 4 presence. Anything the creature is carrying does not count toward the presence total. So, a target holding a magic sword with the presence of 12 would still turn the sword invisible until they drop it. But since the sword has a presence higher than the spells affected amount the sword cannot be targeted.

### Target Selection
You are not able to specify targets for an area attack unless otherwise listed. If you are unaware of a creature’s existence within the area, you cannot deselect them even if the power allows.

### Allowing the Effect
If the target desires to be affected by a power they are aware of, then they can choose to fail the Resistance Check. If the target has multiple personalities controlling it, then only if all the personalities agree can the target choose to fail. If for instance you are possessed by a spirit, the spirit and you may not both agree to being healed or being subject to a paralyzing power.

### Ghostly Damage
Some powers that produce illusions can cause the target to believe they took damage. As long as the target believes the illusion, they will believe the damage to be real as well. If the target were to be reduced to zero LP from Ghostly Damage, they are instead left unconscious. But if Ghostly Damage were to produce a Critical that would kill them, they may still die of shock.

### Repeat Resistance Checks
When a power subjects a target to a Resistance Check that causes a lingering effect, the target gets a new Resistance Check after a number of rounds have passed equal to their Degree of Failure. If the power ends, either due to you no longer maintaining it or due to an external force, the effect also ends without the target having to make another Resistance Check.

### Marking
Some powers cause you to mark the target. The power will list how long a creature will remain marked. Marks usually occur as a result of an Attack or Effect power. What a mark does after being applied is listed with the power that caused it or in another related power.

### Stacking of Powers
Many powers grant bonuses or penalties to any number of different abilities. How each ability handles multiple sources of increase and decrease is described below. In general, only take the best bonus and the worst penalty.

#### Natural Armor
Natural armor is any kind of Armor Value that comes from hardened skin or mystical veil of protection. This value is added to the AV of layer armor to determine your final AV for each Damage Type. When you are subject to multiple natural armor effects, you apply the highest bonus for each Damage Type.

> For Example, you cast the Fire Shroud spell at the base degree and have the Natural Armor Trait. The Fire Shroud spell gives you 5 AV against Heat Damage and the Natural Armor Trait gives you 4 AV for Physical and Elemental Damage. Since Fire Shroud grants a greater benefit, you have 5 AV against Heat Damage and 4 AV for Cold and Electrical damage.

#### Layer Armor
Layer armor is any kind of Armor Value that comes from external worn protection. This value is added to the AV of natural armor to determine your final AV for each Damage Type. When you are wearing multiple layers of armor, you apply the highest AV plus half of the next two greatest Armor Values for that Damage Type. No matter if you are benefitting from a layer of armor or not, while you are wearing it, you are subject to any penalties it applies. Your Wear Armor Skill can reduce these penalties.

#### Damage Vulnerability
Damage vulnerability is when you take additional damage from certain types. This value is added to the Units of Damage calculation. Some creatures naturally have damage vulnerability, like fire elementals and cold damage. When you are subject to multiple damage vulnerabilities, you add the highest vulnerability for each Damage Type to your natural damage vulnerability.

> For example, you cast the Create Vulnerability spell at base degree on a fire elemental. You choose cold damage for the spell. Now, the fire elemental has a final damage vulnerability of 5 (2 from the base degree spell and 3 naturally). So, when you hit the fire elemental with an attack that deals cold damage, you increase the Units of Damage by 5 points. If another caster where to cast Create Vulnerability at the intermediate degree, the fire elemental would instead have a final damage vulnerability of 7 (4 from the intermediate degree spell and 3 naturally, the base degree spell is ignored).

#### Damage Reduction
Damage reduction is when you reduce the Base Damage of an attack or resistance. Some creatures naturally have damage reduction, like fire elementals and heat damage. When you are subject to multiple damage reductions, you add the highest reduction for each Damage Type to your natural damage reduction.

If the damage reduction reduces the Base Damage to zero, you cannot be injured by that attack. Some sources of damage reduction will list that the damage reduction is ignored when the attack can damage immaterial creatures or some other condition. If your greatest source of damage reduction is ignored but a lesser source is not, then you can use that lesser source instead.

> For example, you are the target of Iron Skin spell cast at the intermediate degree and have an artifact that gives you a damage reduction of 2 for all physical damage. Your final damage reduction is 3 since the spell and the artifact grant 3 and 2 respectively. So, when you are the target of an attack that deals impact damage, you reduce the Base Damage by 3 points. 

#### Damage Barrier
A damage barrier represents the minimum Base Damage necessary to harm you for a given Damage Type. This does not reduce the Base Damage of the attack, only negates the damage if the Base Damage is less than the damage barrier. When you are subject to multiple damage barriers, you apply the highest value for each Damage Type. Even if you naturally have a damage barrier, only the highest one will apply.

Some damage barriers can be ignored by certain criteria. The most common is if the attack can damage immaterial creatures. If your greatest source of damage barrier is ignored but a lesser source is not, then you can use that lesser source instead.

#### Damage Resistance
Damage resistance is when you reduce the Final Damage of an attack or resistance. Some creatures naturally have damage resistance, like greater earth elementals and physical damage. When you are subject to multiple damage resistances, you add the highest resistance for each Damage Type to your natural damage resistance.

If the damage reduction reduces the Final Damage to zero, you were not injured by that attack. Some sources of damage resistance will list that the damage resistance is ignored when the attack can damage immaterial creatures or some other condition. If your greatest source of damage resistance is ignored but a lesser source is not, then you can use that lesser source instead.

#### Skill Bonus and Penalty
A skill bonus gained from multiple powers will apply the highest bonus, then half of the second highest, a third of the third highest, and so on. A skill penalty gained from multiple powers will apply the highest penalty, then half of the second highest, a third of the third highest, and so on. Always round down for bonuses and penalties.

Any bonus or penalty that comes from a Maneuver, Situation, or State are added together, unless explicitly stated otherwise like with Blind and Surprised.

#### Characteristic Bonus and Penalty
A characteristic bonus or penalty will increase or decrease one of your Characteristics, such as Strength or Perception. Any bonus gained from multiple powers will apply the greatest bonus. Any penalty gained from multiple powers will apply the worst penalty. 

Some powers allow you to sacrifice a point in a characteristic to gain some special benefit. When this is done, it actually reduces your base Characteristic, so it does not count as a penalty.

## Supernatural Barriers
The most common type of defense power is one that employs a supernatural barrier. This barrier is used to block incoming attacks, in much the same manner as using the Block Skill, but it has a few key differences.

### Defending with a Barrier
The first thing to remember about barriers is that they are not a complete shield against attacks. You must use a Defensive Skill, the exact skill will depend on the power, to maneuver the barrier in front of the attack. Failure to do so will cause the attacker to get past your barrier and strike you. This works exactly like a Defensive Roll, so the Degree of Success that the attacker gains and your AV and Absorption are used to calculate how much damage you take.

When you do successfully block with a barrier, the barrier will absorb the attack and take damage equal to the Base Damage of the Attack times ten. Each power will list how much damage a barrier can take before breaking.

### Barrier Break
When an attack reduces a barrier's Life Points to zero, it breaks. Then whoever is protected by the barrier automatically suffer any damage not absorbed by the barrier. You can reduce the damage by 1 point for each AV against that Damage Type. Damage reduction and damage resistance will both only reduce the final damage taken, but damage barrier works as normal.

### Barriers and other Defenses
You can only rely on one method of defense against any single attack. If you defend yourself by Dodging an attack, then a barrier trying to block will only get in the way and vice versa. If a barrier is unable to block an attack, you are not able to then Block or Dodge as there is not enough time to react. Similarly, if you are covered by multiple barriers, you can only use one of them to block since they would get in each other’s way.

### Covering Others with Barriers
A barrier can be used to cover someone other than its creator, but due to the complexity to creating and controlling a barrier at a distance some special rules apply.

First, a barrier used to protect someone else must have been created as an Active Action, instead of a Swift Action as part of the Defense, before the target is attacked.

Second, you are the one who makes the Defensive Rolls for the target and suffer two degrees of Disadvantage. If the target moves past the effective range of your powers, the Disadvantage increases to four degrees. Beyond the maximum range of your powers you are unable to protect the target. If you are subject to a State that modifies your Defensive Roll, it also applies when making Defensive Rolls for the target. If the target is subject to a Situation that modifies their Defensive Roll, it applies when making Defensive Rolls for the target.

Third, like when you defend yourself with a barrier, the target must choose whether to rely on your barrier or their own Defensive Skills when attacked. 

> For example, Ceil has cast Shield of Light on Thom. Thom has become Fully Restrained as a result of a Trapping Maneuver by a bandit. When another bandit tries to attack Thom, he can choose to defend with his Dodge Skill (which has a -20 penalty due to the Fully Restrained State) or rely on Ciel’s Magic Projection (which has a D2 due to covering others). Thom choses the barrier. Later in the combat, Ceil also becomes Fully Restrained, and the -20 penalty then also applies when Thom relies on the barrier for defense.

#### Covering an Area
Instead of covering a single target, you can expand a barrier to protect multiple creatures. Like with covering a single creature other than yourself, some additional rules apply.

First, a barrier used to protect an area can be created using a Swift Action as part of the Defense as long as you are one of the covered creatures. If you are not, you must use a barrier that you had created before the attack.

Second, you are the one who makes a single Defensive Roll for all creatures under your barrier and you suffer two degrees of Disadvantage. You can cover a circular area whose radius is equal to your Focus Characteristic in feet. The barrier takes damage for each creature protected. If a barrier breaks, divide the remaining damage evenly among the protected creatures.

Third, like when you defend yourself with a barrier, each protected creature can choose whether to rely on your barrier or their own Defensive Skills when attacked.

## Power Collision
It is possible for two powers or supernaturally charged objects to collide with one another. The results of the collision will depend on the strength of the colliding projectiles. To create a collision, you must meet three criteria: you have to take the Collide Power Reaction, be in a position and have the ability to make a parallel shot, and have an Initiative within 5 points of the opponent that launched the original projectile, or surpass their Initiative. Then you use a ranged Attack Power (or shoot a supernaturally charged projectile) at the opposing Power. You make an Offensive Roll and the result must be within 5 points of the opposing roll, or surpass it. If you achieve this result, then both you and the opponent roll 2d6 and add the Base Damage of the Power. The Degree of Difference (DoD) is compared to the below table.

TABLE

It is possible to have two or more powers combine during a collision. The value added to the Collision roll is the highest Base Damage of the combined Powers, and then half the second greatest, and a third of the third greatest, and so on.
