This chapter contains rules for handling combat. Combat is done by having all participants declare their intentions for that round of combat and rolling [@skill Initiative @]. When it is your turn, you can perform actions like attacking or casting spells. When it is not your turn, you can still perform some limited set of actions such as counterattacking or talking. The Game Master should use the rules for combat anytime there is contested actions.
