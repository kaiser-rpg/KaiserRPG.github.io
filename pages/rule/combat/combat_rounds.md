Each round of combat is composed of three phases: Intention, Action, End. The first phase, Intention, has each combatant declaring what they intend to do that round and roll their Initiative. The Action phase is composed to each combatant performing actions, the higher their Initiative the sooner they can perform their actions. The End phase handles special conditions.

### Intention Phase
The Intention Phase is where you will tell the GM what you intend to do that round, which will influence the actions that you can take. What you intend to do is called an Intention and each one will cost a certain amount of AP. For example, Accumulate Ki is one such Intention you could take and it costs you 1 AP. You can declare multiple Intentions, but can only declare each one once. With all your Intentions declared and the proper AP spent, you can then roll your Initiative which is modified by some Intentions. Your Initiative is used in the Action Phase to determine who will be able to act before you.

A full list of Intentions can be found [here](rule_combat_action_point.html).

#### Surprise
When rolling Initiative, there is a chance that you might react so quickly that your opponent is caught off guard. This occurs when your Initiative roll is 20 points greater than your opponents. In this case, your opponent gains the Surprised State when making any Opposed Skill Checks against you until they take their turn.

### Action Phase
The Action Phase is when each combatant takes turns performing actions. The combatant who has the highest Initiative roll goes first, then the second highest goes, and so on. In the case of a tie, the combatant with the highest Initiative Value (the number added to the die roll) acts first.

There are three types of actions that you can perform each round: Active, Reaction, Swift.

When it is your turn, you can perform Active Actions. If you have unused Active Actions, you can choose to delay your turn. While delayed, you can choose to take your turn after any other combatant. If you and another combatant are both delaying and all other combatants have taken their full turn, the combatant with the lowest Initiative must take the rest of their turn before the one with the higher Initiative. You can also chose to end your turn and not spend any of your remaining AP.

You can perform Reactions when a certain condition is meet, even if it occurs in the middle of another combatants turn. The most common Reaction is called Counter is can be taken after your opponent fails to hit you with an attack. You can then perform the Attack Action, which is normally Active, as a Reaction.

Swift Actions can be performed at anytime and does not require a triggering action, like Reaction. Swift Actions are things like Defending yourself or talking.

Once everyone has taken all their Active Actions and no one has any other Swift Actions they want to take, move to the End Phase. The Action Phase lasts six seconds of in-game time.

### End Phase
The End Phase is when certain end of round actions will occur. These End Phase actions are described with the feature or power that uses them.

The most common End Phase action you will see is to reduce the countdown of a condition by one round. If the countdown is reduced to zero, you can make another Resistance Check against it or it ends (that is described by the power that caused the condition).
