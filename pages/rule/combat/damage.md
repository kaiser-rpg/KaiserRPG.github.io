## Damage Types
In Kaiser, there are twelve types of damage that an attack can use. These damages are sorted into four groups to handle broad references. The groups are Physical, Elemental, Energy, and Resistance. 

### Physical Damage
Damage in the Physical Damage Group are those done by physical objects, like weapons or rocks.

**Cut**: This damage is done by weapons moving in a slicing motion. Objects carried by strong winds and swinging axes are common sources of this damage type.

**Impact**: When you are struck by heavy blunt objects, or run into them, you take Impact Damage. Falling a great distance and Warhammers are common sources of this damage.

**Thrust**: Weapons that deal damage by impaling you deal Thrust damage. Spears and arrows are common sources of this damage.

### Elemental Damage
The Elemental Damage Group contains damage dealt by exposure to extreme elemental forces like fire.

**Heat**: This damage occurs when an attack produces an intense amount of damage. Standing inside a bonfire or being struck by a fire elemental are common sources of this type of damage.

**Cold**: Low temperatures cause this damage. The icy blast of a spell or the frost breath of a dragon are common sources of this damage.

**Electrical**: Being struck by lightning or an electrical discharge are common sources of this damage.

### Energy Damage
The Energy Damage Group is commonly caused by supernatural effects. Most spells use one of the damage types from this group.

**Force**: This damage comes from raw energy and is immaterial in nature. Bolts of magical energy and repulsive blasts are common sources of this damage type.

**Light**: Intense beams of light are common sources of this damage type.

**Dark**: Shadowy energies are common sources of this damage type.

### Resistance Group
Damage Types in this Group are usually only done as part of a failed Resistance Check. Armor against these types of damage only apply to a Resistance Check that deals their damage and not to the roll to be hit by a Resistance Attack.

**Atomic**: This is damage done at the atomic level. Your atoms being rearranged or acidic substances melting stone are common sources of this damage.

**Bio**: This type of damage is done on the cellular level. Things likes poisons, diseases, or strong basic substances breaking down cell walls are all common sources of this damage type.

**Psychic**: This damage is one dealt directly to the mind. Psychic screams and mental torture are common sources of this type of damage. This is also the damage that most Illusions deal, but if the target is not aware of the illusory nature of an attack special rules apply that can be found in the Advanced Combat Chapter.

## Critical Damage
It is inevitable that you suffer damage in combat. However, not all damage involves merely losing a set number of Life Points. When you receive a single wound that makes you lose half your remaining LP, you have received a Critical hit. 

{%% include example.html content="An individual with 180 LP who receives a single hit that causes him to lose 90 or more Life Points has suffered a Critical. With his LP now reduced to 90, another hit causing just 45 LP more would cause another Critical."}

Whenever you suffer a Critical, the possibility exists that a very serious wound will result in broken bones or even lost limbs. To find the result, it is necessary to calculate the level of the Critical. The attacker rolls 2d6 (no Open Rolls or Fumbles) and adds that to 1/10 the damage produced by the attack, round down. The result is the Critical level. Reduce any amount above 20 by half and add that to the total. Thus, the GM would reduce a Critical level of 26 to 23 (6/2 + 20) and a level of 31 to 25 (11/2 +20).

Then, you must Physical Resistance Check against the level of Critical. If your total is higher than the Critical level, you pass the Resistance Check and suffers no further ill effects from the hit – other than the original Life Point damage. However, if you fail the PhR Check, the Degree of Failure determines the effects of the Critical.

### Effects of a Critical
In this section we will explain the different effects that Criticals can produce, as seen in the following table.

When you fail the PhR Check, you automatically suffer an All Action Penalty equal to the Degree of Failure. For each DoF, you lose 1 AP. The result of the Critical can be found on the following table.

{% include table-index.html %}

If the DoF is 5 or less, the attack may have been painful, but it leaves nothing more than some bruises and a nice scar. You gain an All Action Penalty, caused by momentary shock and pain, not any lasting physical effects, and it disappears at a rate of 1 per round until it vanishes completely. It isn’t necessary, therefore, to determine the location of the hit, because there are no additional effects.

If the DoF is greater than 5, the damage you suffer involves something seriously incapacitating – like broken bones or joint dislocations. The Action Penalty will last until you recover based on your Regeneration Value. If the attack was not a Directed Attack, use the General Hit Location Table to decide the body part affected. If it hits the head, the combatant is automatically unconscious.

For a DoF higher than 10, the attack has destroyed the part of the body that was hit. As before, the Action Penalty recovers as per the rules for Regeneration. If the part hit turns out to be an arm or leg, the GM should consider that limb useless – whether due to being crushed or otherwise heavily damaged – or even amputated. If the strike was a Directed Attack (not rolled randomly) at the heart or head (or some equally vulnerable part of a non-human's anatomy), you instantly lose consciousness and will die in a number of rounds equal to your Constitution, unless you receive medical attention with a Difficulty Check of 28.

Finally, if DoF is above 15, the effects are exactly as stated in the previous case, except that you also instantly lose consciousness, no matter where you were hit. While unconscious, you will die in a number of minutes equal to your Constitution, unless you receive medical attention with a Difficulty Check of 16.

As always, creating an appropriately colorful description for Criticals is in the hands of the Game Master. If fighting occurs with creatures whose bodies are very different from those of humans, the GM might need to adjust the location of hits.

### Vulnerable Points
There are certain places on the body that are more vulnerable to Criticals than others. These vulnerable points are areas most sensitive to damage. If you receive a blow directed at a vulnerable point, losing a mere 10% of your current Life Points is enough to cause a Critical.

For any human, the head and heart are vulnerable points – although animals and supernatural creatures may not follow that pattern. Some entities, in fact, don’t even have such weak points; hitting them for half their remaining LP is the only way to cause them a Critical.

{%% include example.html content="With 160 LP and in perfect health, Klaus needs to lose 80 LP from a single hit to cause a Critical and make a PhR Check. But an attack directed at his head only needs to cause 16 points before he is forced to make such a check because his head is a vulnerable point."}

## Damage Resistance
Very large animals and some supernatural creatures use a special means of defense called Damage Resistance. Rather than using either the Block or Dodge Abilities to protect themselves, these creatures depend on their enormous capacity to absorb physical damage. For that reason, a number of slightly different rules are used for them in combat.

First, these creatures do not lose AP when they suffer damage. However, they are unable to take advantage of a Counter, and therefore must wait until it is their turn to act during the round.

They also do not possess any defensive capacity except their own absorption and armor. Their roll is always considered to be zero and they are unable to increase their Block or Dodge Skill. If a being with Damage Resistance is attacked by surprise, its Absorption is halved.

Beings with Damage Resistance can also utilize magical or psychic shields – if they have the ability to create such defenses. However, they use them with a -8 to their Projection Ability, and if the shield’s defense is overcome, the creatures loses an AP.

Criticals also work in a special way against creatures with Damage Resistance. Although they must lose half their Life Points with a single attack to suffer a Critical, the GM should automatically reduce the level of the Critical by half, even without reaching 20. 

If a creature with Damage Resistance receives an Area Attack that covers at least half its body, it receives double the damage. Although Area Attacks are most often produced by supernatural means (fireballs, cones of destruction, etc.), the damage from a weapon with a Sweeping Attack sufficiently large enough to cover half the creature’s body is also doubled.
