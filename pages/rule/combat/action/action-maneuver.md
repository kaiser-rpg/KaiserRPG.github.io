As part of an _Attack Action_, instead of a traditional attack, you can perform a maneuver. Each maneuver describes the types of rolls that you and the target must make. Some maneuvers are complex, they require you to spend AP to perform them or might require some other conditions. 

Some powers also let you perform these maneuvers. A power will list what maneuver you will use and any modifications to the maneuver. Additionally, attack powers can use certain maneuvers as part of the _Use Power Action_.
