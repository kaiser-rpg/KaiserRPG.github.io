## Tectonic Smash
Once you strength has reached exceptionally high levels, you can produce tremors. Depending on your Strength Characteristic, the tremor will be stronger and effect a greater distance. In order to perform this, you must have the Zen Talent, or higher for the greater degrees.

In order to pull this off, you must declare your intention to do so and it takes your complete turn. On the End Phase of the turn that you declare the Intention, the tremor starts. The tremor stops on the End Phase after a number of rounds have passed. Anyone within the radius of the tremor must make an Agility Characteristic Check listed or fall prone.

Additionally, the Game Master can have tremors form as a secondary effect of an attack, usually at a much lower level.

**True Instinct**: Your perception and natural instinct has been honed to an inhuman level. You cannot be dazzled by bright lights and half the penalties from Blindness caused by non-magical darkness, as if you had the Night Vision Feature. If you already possess the Night Vision Feature, you can completely ignore Blindness. You require Inhuman to benefit from this.

**Sense Surroundings**: You can feel your surroundings, using all of your senses to track everything. If you also have Mastery in Notice or Search, you can sense invisible creatures that do not also have Mastery in Stealth. You require Legendary to benefit from this.

**Radial Perception**: You can perfectly sense all your surroundings, this grants you the Radial Vision Feature. You require Legendary to benefit from this.

**Absolute Perception**: You perceive the world as atoms and energy. This lets you see through thin materials and understand the motion of bodies as they occur. You gain a +3 bonus on all physical Opposed Skill Checks, not Difficulty Skill Checks.

**Supernatural Sight**: You can see the supernatural energies as well as the atomic energies, this grants you the See Supernatural Feature. If you already possess See Supernatural Feature, you instead gain the Eyes of Truth Feature.

**Sight of Destiny**: You can sense the flow of destiny, this grants you the Nornir Vision Feature.
