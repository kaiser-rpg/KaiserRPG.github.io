## Damage During Accumulation
When you suffer damage, you might lose concentration on the ki you have stored in your chakras. You must make a Withstand Pain Difficulty Check equal to one fifth of the damage. Each Degree of Failure causes 1 ki to return to your Ki Reserve from what you have accumulated, you can choose the chakra. If you have more than 10 DoF, the ki is lost instead of returned to your Reserve.
