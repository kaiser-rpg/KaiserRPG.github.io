Techniques are powerful spiritual abilities that can be performed after mastering control over your ki. Before you can start to learn your first Technique, you must learn the Gross Ki Control and Fine Ki Control talents. The capabilities that a Technique can possess are vast.

## Technique Trees
Each Technique belongs to a group called a Technique Tree and are ordered in levels of one to three. Basic Techniques, level 1, are generally useful but not all that powerful. Advanced Techniques, level 2, are your classic finishing moves and can be very powerful. Arcane Techniques, level 3, can only be mastered by those dedicated to the spiritual arts. 

When learning Techniques in a tree, you must first learn the basics before moving on. Generally, before learning an Advanced Technique, you must first have mastered two of the Basic Techniques from that tree. Arcane Techniques are similar, requiring you to have mastered two Advanced Techniques from that tree. This relation holds even after the first one; to learn the second Advanced Technique, you must first master two more of the Basic Techniques. You can always learn all of the Basic Techniques before learning Advanced Techniques, and the same goes for Advanced and Arcane Techniques.

## Creating Techniques
The Game Master can freely create Technique Trees using the rules found in the Technique Creation page. When the GM makes a Technique Tree, they can change the rules for requirements as they see fit. If you wish to make a Technique Tree, ask the Game Master.
