Ki is a form of energy created as a by-product of a spirit inhabiting a body. Every single body that possess a spirit will have a Ki Reserve, which represents the current and total amount of ki that that body holds. Once you have mastered the talent called Use of Ki, you can pull ki into your chakras to perform other talents.

Without a container, ki dissipates into nothing. The container it is stored in must have some amount of life force to properly store the spiritual energy.

## Ki Reserve
Your maximum Ki Reserve is determined by your Characteristics and Experience. You gain 2 ki point for each point in your Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Agility, Focus, and Willpower Characteristics. To this you add any Innate Bonus and ki purchased using Experience Points -- ki gained through XP comes in groups of ten.

## Chakras
Chakras are the points where you body and spirit are connected. You possess three different chakras. Red chakra is your physical strength and resiliency; it is based on your Strength and Constitution Characteristics. Green chakra is your physical speed and reaction time; it is based on your Dexterity and Agility Characteristics. Blue chakra is your spiritual prowess; it is based on your Focus and Willpower Characteristics.

When you want to use a talent, you must start to gather ki into your chakras. This act of gathering is known as Chakra Accumulation (CA) and each chakra will have its own value. The starting value for each CA depends on the sum of the Characteristics it is based on; compare the sum to the table below. You can spend Experience Points to increase one of your Chakra Accumulations by one point.

## Ki Recovery
Every hour, your body produces 5 ki that your Ki Reserve can absorb. This recovery is an innate capacity of your body and spirit and does not require any kind of action on your part. You do not regain any ki if you are maintaining or sustaining any talents.

## Effects of Highly Accumulated Ki
The act of accumulating ki into your chakras is very powerful and causes your spirit's pressure upon to the world to increase. This pressure can cause many different environmental effects that you have no control over. To find out how must pressure you are giving off and its effects, take the sum of your accumulated ki and compare it to the effects below. You can subtract your Final Conceal Spirit Skill before comparing it below.

**20 Points**: At this amount, your aura starts to become visible in the material plane. Animals will sense this pressure and might consider you a threat or flee.

**40 Points**: Your spiritual energy is such that the loose materials around you start to vibrate or a small breeze will blow out form you.

**60 Points**: The energies gathered are now enough to give off a small amount of light, no greater than a candle. The light might emit from your eyes, hands, heart, or just outline your body. As your accumulated ki grows, so to does the light. The color of the light is determined by your nature.

**80 Points**: The earth itself shudders that the power you have gathered. Small storms and strong winds will appear around you. In extreme circumstances, a full blown storm might break out. Any individual with 3 presence or less and unable to perform Inhuman actions will be unable to approach you without passing a Strength Characteristic Check equal to your Focus Characteristic + 4.

**100 Points**: The air gains a certain taste to it, unique to you. All creatures within a mile feel a great tension, even if they do not know why.

**120 Points or more**: At this point, the effects of accumulation are so great that it is left up to the Game Master to decide.
