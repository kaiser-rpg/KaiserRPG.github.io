Ki is a form of energy created as a by-product of a spirit inhabiting a body. Every single body that possess a spirit will have a Ki Reserve, which represents the current and total amount of ki that that body holds. Once you have mastered the talent called Use of Ki, you can pull ki into your chakras to perform other talents.

Ki cannot exist outside of a container, it requires some amount of life force to persist.

## Ki Reserve
Your maximum Ki Reserve is determined by your Characteristics and Experience. You gain 2 ki point for each point in your Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Agility, Focus, and Willpower Characteristics. To this you add any Innate Bonus and ki purchased using Experience Points -- ki gained through XP comes in groups of ten.

## Chakras
Chakras are the points where you body and spirit are connected. You possess three different chakras. Red chakra is your physical strength and resiliency; it is based on your Strength and Constitution Characteristics. Green chakra is your physical speed and reaction time; it is based on your Dexterity and Agility Characteristics. Blue chakra is your spiritual prowess; it is based on your Focus and Willpower Characteristics.

When you want to use a talent, you must start to gather ki into your chakras. This act of gathering is known as Chakra Accumulation (CA) and each chakra will have its own value. The starting value for each CA depends on the sum of the Characteristics it is based on; compare the sum to the table below. You can spend Experience Points to increase one of your Chakra Accumulations by one point.

## Ki Recovery
Your body produces 5 ki that your Ki Reserve can absorb. This recovery is an innate capacity of your body and spirit and does not require any kind of action on your part. You do not regain any ki if you are maintaining or sustaining any talents.
