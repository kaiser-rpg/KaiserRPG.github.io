Spirit knowledge is the measure of your capacity to learn and understand the innerworkings of your body and spirit, which allows you to perform talents. Your maximum spirit knowledge starts at zero but increases based on your Class's innate bonus. By investing one Experience Point, you can increase the maximum by one point. Learning some martial arts will also increase your spirit knowledge. When you gain new spirit knowledge, you do not immediately invest them, you must use Downtime to learn talents just as a warrior must learn a new fighting style.

{% include meta.html content="Unlike mana knowledge, it is recommended that you allow a character to invest all of their spirit knowledge during character creation since spirit knowledge is gained in short bursts, as opposed to mana knowledge's large starting value. Any unspent spirit knowledge or any gained later can be invested during Downtime." %}
