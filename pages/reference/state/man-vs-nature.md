## Falling
You are considered to have the Falling State when you cannot stop your rapid decent towards a surface. The greater the height you fell, the greater the damage you take upon impact with a surface.

You can reduce the damage from landing by making an Acrobatics Skill Check against a difficulty determined by the distance you have fallen. If you are successful, you take no damage. If you fail, use the Degree of Failure like the Degree of Success on an attack. You apply your Absorption and Impact AV to calculate the Units of Damage. Since larger creatures take greater damage due to their large mass, the Final Damage is equal to the Units of Damage multiplied by the Base Damage as well as your Size Damage Modifier.

### Distance Fallen Each Round

A standard human on a standard planet will fall 500 feet the first round and then each round that follows, they will fall 1000 feet. 

## Lack of Air
You are considered to have the Lack of Air State when you cannot take in fresh air. If you were unprepared for the lack of air, each End Phase you must make a Difficulty Characteristic Check of 10 with your Constitution. Failure means you have run out of air and are at risk of falling unconscious. If you were prepared, the initial Characteristic Check is 5. Each time you pass the check, the difficulty increases by one. Additionally, some situations might cause you to lose your breath.

Once you run out of air, you need to make a Physical Resistance Check each round to stay conscious. The difficulty starts at 8 and increases by 1 point with every success. Every round you are without air, you also gain a -1 All Action Penalty.

If the All Action Penalty ever increases to twice your Constitution Characteristic, you die due to asphyxiation.

## Sleep
You are considered to have the Sleep State while you are asleep. You suffer a `-10` penalty on all Perception based Skill and Characteristic Checks, do not roll Initiative, and cannot take any actions. You can be shaken awake quickly as an Active Action costing 2 AP, you can then roll Initiative next round. Something injuring you or making a loud sound will cause you to wake up and roll Initiative with a a `-4` penalty next round.

## Partially Blind
You are considered to have the Partially Blind State when you cannot see your opponent clearly but can still see large movements. For example, a flash or light or a shadowy area.

This state is not to be confused with the Flanked or From Behind States. While they can both occur, Flanking is due to positioning but you can still turn to see your opponent as part of the Defensive Roll.

## Totally Blind
You are considered to have the Totally Blind State when you cannot see your opponent at all due to an issue with vision. For example, an area of complete darkness.

## Proned
You are considered to have the Proned State when you are lying on the ground or sitting. An opponent who is close to you can also gain the Higher Ground State over you.

## Narrow Space
You are considered to have the Narrow Space State when you are in a space that limits your movements. You also gain this state when you are trying to limit your swings to avoid damage to nearby objects, such as bystanders.

A normal human will gain this state when in a space that is less than 3 feet wide.

## Partially Restrained
You are considered to have the Partially Restrained State when your movement is slightly restricted. For example, your arm is chained to the wall.

Your Speed and other values might be modified further by the restraint.

## Mostly Restrained
You are considered to have the Mostly Restrained State when your movement is limited. For example, your arms and legs are in chains.

Your Speed and other values might be modified further by the restraint.

## Fully Restrained
You are considered to have the Fully Restrained State when you are fully and completely immobilized. For example, you are paralyzed.

In addition to the penalties, you cannot take any action and your Movement Value becomes zero while in this state. Your other values might be modified further by the restraint.
