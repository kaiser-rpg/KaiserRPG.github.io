## Flanked
You are considered to have the Flanked State over an opponent when you are positioned at their side and slightly behind them. Naturally, they can turn to face you if they are aware and can react fact enough.

A normal sized human can keep three opponents in front of herself, but the fourth and fifth opponent will gain the Flanked State over you.

## Blind-Side
You considered to have the Blind-Side State over an opponent when you are positioned behind them or in a position they cannot normally see.

A normal sized human can keep three opponents in front of herself; the fourth and fifth opponent will gain the Flanked State over her. The sixth opponent will gain the Blind-Side State over her.

## At Weapon's Point
You gain the At Weapon's Point State over an opponent when you have put a weapon in a threatening position. After you have successfully performed the Put At Weapon's Point Maneuver, you gain the At Weapon's Point State over your target. You can use this to attack your opponent as a Swift Action. Once used this way, the state ends.

## Suspended
You are considered to have the Suspended State over an opponent when they are held in the air without complete control over their movement.

## Flight
You are considered to have the Flight State over an opponent when you have a Flight Speed that is 7 points higher theirs and have ample room to maneuver. 

## Surprised
You are considered to have the Surprised State over an opponent when you have caught them off-guard. This can also occur when your Initiative Roll is 20 points greater than your opponents, and they have not yet taken their turn this round.

## Charmed
You are considered to have the Charmed State over an opponent when you used a power that makes them friendly and suggestible. They will not attack you and will try to follow through with what you ask. But demands that go against their nature or abusive actions break the state.

The duration of this state will depend on its source. If caused by a power, the power will list how long it lasts, generally one round per DoF.
