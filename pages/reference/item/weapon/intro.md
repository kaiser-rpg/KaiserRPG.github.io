## Weapon Profile
Each weapon possess several characteristics that make up its profile.

**Name**: The name of the weapon

**Group**: The group or groups that the weapon belongs to. Classic, Projectile, Seige, Shield, and Art are the five groups.

**Weapon Type**: The type of weapon it is. Further detail on Weapon Type is found below.

**Weapon Damage**: The amount of damage that the weapon does. This is added to the Base Damage of an attack.

**Presence**: The same as your presence.

**Damage Type**: The type of damage that the weapon deals. The primary Damage Type is listed first, if the weapon is capable of Secondary Damage Types that are lasted next.

**Breakage**: The weapon's ability to break other objects.

**Fortitude**: The weapon's ability to resist breaking.

**Weapon Cost**: The Action Point cost used as part of the [@action Attack @] intention.

**Initiative Penalty**: This number is subtracted from your Initiative when you declare the use of this weapon. If you declare multiple weapons, you only use the greatest penalty.

**Size**: The size of the weapon. This determines how many creatures you are target as part of a [@action Sweeping Attack @] maneuver and the penalty to perform multiple attacks.

**Required Strength**: The Strength Value you must have to properly wield the weapon. Further details are listed below.

**Traits**: Any traits the weapon possess. See the [Traits Section](rule_gameplay_trait.html) for a list of what each Trait does.

If it is a weapon that can be thrown or is used to fire a projectile, it will also have the following characteristics.

**Rate of Throwing (RoT)**: The rate at which you can throw the weapon. See the [Ranged Combat Section](rule_combat_ranged.html) for further details.

**Reload**: How many turns it takes to reload this weapon after firing it. See the [Ranged Combat Section](rule_combat_ranged.html) for further details.

**Clip**: This value is only listed if the weapon can fire more than one ammo before needing to be reloaded.

**Range**: The maximum distance that the weapon can be thrown or fired. Anything beyond this value is unreachable. You Strength Characteristic, or the one inherent to the Fired weapon can increase this value. 

## Types of Weapons

**Short Arm**: Small weapons, such as short swords and daggers, are considered Short Arms.

**Axe**: Axes are weapons that are used to hack at an opponent.

**Mace**: Blunt impact weapons are considered Maces.

**Sword**: Weapons with long cutting edges are considered Swords.

**Two-handed**: A Two-handed weapon is one that is large and designed to be wielded without using both hands. If the weapon does not possess the Heavy trait and you have sufficient strength, you can use the weapon in one hand.

**Pole**: A weapon with a long shaft usually topped with some type of damaging implement is a Pole weapon. 

**Cord**: Flexible links of chain, leather, or rope or stiff fabric are considered Cord weapons.

**Shield**: Shields are primarily a defensive implement. If you declared the use of a shield, you gain its bonus to [@skill Block @] Checks and half that bonus to [@skill Dodge @], round down. You do not suffer a penalty to block with your offhand. Unlike normal weapons, the Initiative Penalty of a shield is always applied, along with the slowest weapon's Initiative Penalty.

**Unarmed**: With the right training, you body is a weapon.

**Throwing**: A weapon that is launched by your hand is a Throwing weapon. When defending against a Thrown projectile, you suffer additional penalties.

**Firing**: A weapon that launches a projectile with great force is a Firing weapon. When defending against a Fired projectile, you suffer additional penalties. The Weapon Damage is determined by the Ammo used, as such the Quality Bonus of a Firing weapon does not affect its Weapon Damage.

**Ammo**: Ammo is what is launched out of a Firing weapon. The Weapon Damage is determined by the Ammo, as such the Quality Bonus of Ammo does not affect the Offensive Roll.

**Improvised**: Improvised weapons are those not designed for combat. The Game Master can use the listed Improvised weapons to determine the weapon profile of other possible Improvised weapons.

**Power**: This is a special weapon type that only applies to powers. Some Great Arts and Artifacts are Power weapons.

**Variable**: The true class of a Variable weapon is determined by what its base profile is. Some Impossible Weapons allow you to use a special version of an existing weapon, in which case the Impossible Weapon would have same type as its base weapon.

## Required Strength
Each weapon has a certain amount of Strength required to wield it properly. For each point below that value, you suffer a -1 penalty to Strike and Block with that weapon.

Some Two-handed weapons list two Strength Requirements. The first one is the [@stat Strength @] required to use it with two hands, the second is the [@stat Strength @] to use it in one hand.

## Oversized Weapons
A weapon that is larger than normal might do more damage, depending on its design. Generally, for each Size Group larger than normal, the Game Master applies the following changes to the weapon:

- +3 Strength Requirement
- +50% Weapon Damage
- +3 Breakage
- +6 Fortitude

Additionally, a weapon that is two Size Groups larger than you causes you to apply a special `-4` penalty to [@skill Initiative @] while you hold the weapon -- even if you do not declare its use. Three Size Groups larger applies a `-8` penalty, and four applies a `-12`.

## Weapons of Quality
Each point of quality that a weapon possess gives it the following benefits:
- `+1/2` bonus to Strike
- `+1/2` bonus to Block
- Reduce Initiative Penalty by `-1` for every 2 quality
- `+1` Weapon Damage
- `+5` Presence
- `+5` Breakage
- `+10` Fortitude
- Ignore 1 AV

Each point of negative quality gives it the following penalties:
- `-1` penalty to Strike
- `-1` penalty to Block
- Increase Initiative Penalty by 1
- `-1` Weapon Damage
- `-5` Breakage
- `-10` Fortitude (minimum of 1)
