Resisting this phenom requires all targets to make a Mental Resistance Check against the listed Difficulty. Failing this check does not allow a target a new Resistance Check while they remain in the scanned area. This phenom does not use Phenom Projection since it automatically affects everyone within the area. A target can choose to fail if they recognize that they are a target."

You can only restrain Active actions – those that must be taken on their turn or performed during a Counter. The target may resist the effect by making a successful Mental Resistance Check against the listed Difficulty. The target can make a new Resistance Check each time they attempt to carry out the restrained action. In the case of a broad restraint, or if it limits the target excessively, a +4 bonus may be applied to the Resistance Check.",
