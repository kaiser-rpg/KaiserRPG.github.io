# New Spell Types

Physical Control:
While you are in control, the target cannot use their AP to perform any action that requires physical control. As a Swift Action, you can cause the target to perform a physical action with the proper action requirement. Any AP cost of an action that you command comes from your AP instead of the target's. As this power only allows you to control their physical actions, you cannot control them to use a power, but the target might be able to use their mental actions to perform a power.

The target gains a new Resistance Check whenever they take damage or when they are given a command that goes against their nature -- in this case the target also gains a +2 deed bonus to the Resistance Check.

Total Control:
While you are in control, the target cannot use their AP to perform any action. As a Swift Action, you can cause the target to perform an action with the proper action requirement. Any AP cost of an action that you command comes from your AP instead of the target's. As this power grants you complete control, you have limited control over the powers of the creature. Any accumulation is halved and their Potential is halved.
